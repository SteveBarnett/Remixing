Hi, I’m Steve Barnett. Here are some of the things I do.

## Personal

I **read** quite a bit. Around the start of 2018 I started tracking what I read on [my goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/max_barners). I tend to read sci-fi, psychology, philosophy, and work books. I often [write up my notes on index cards](/notes/) to help me summarise and remember the content. Here's [a short review of my 2022](/review/2022/).

I like making **pictures**. Of cats, dogs, and other odd things. Often abstract or strange juxtapositions. I go by the nickname Max Barners. [See some of my photos on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/maxbarners/). Sometimes [I like to sketch and draw](/art/), especially in small and weird ways.

I like **music**. I made themed playlists for a series of "house parties for grown ups" (start early, dance a lot, finish early). The mixes live at [my profile on Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/MaxBarners/). I tinker with making electronic music using Ableton Live and [post the music here](/music/) and to [my SoundCloud profile](https://soundcloud.com/maxbarners).
  
## Work

I make web sites. More specifically: I’m a human-centered front-end developer and user experience designer. [Read more at my site naga.co.za](https://naga.co.za/).
