Hi, I’m Steve Barnett.

I tend to be quite reflective. I like setting [Themes for years](/themes/) (and months) and then [reviewing](/review/) the years (and months).

## Personal

I like **reading** for fun and for learning. I keep a [reading list](/reading/) here (and on [my goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/max_barners)). I try to read widely, but I particularly like sci-fi, psychology, and (several flavours of) philosophy. I write up notes to help me summarise and remember stuff. I used to do that on mostly on [index cards](/notes/), but at the moment I mostly put the notes in my [thinking section](/thinking/), in a digital [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book)-like format.

I like making **pictures**, with cameras or pens and pencils. Often abstract, strange juxtapositions, or iconography and patterns. I go by the nickname Max Barners. [See some of my photos on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/maxbarners/). [I like to sketch and draw](/art/), especially in small and weird ways. I've also dabbled with making [music](/music/), just for fun.

I occasionally run small ["events"](/eventing/) for small(ish) groups of friends. I'm one of the organisers for [One Mindful Breath](https://www.onemindfulbreath.org.nz/), a secular dharma practice community in Wellington, Aotearoa New Zealand.
  
## Work

I make **websites**. More specifically: I’m a human-centered front-end developer and user experience designer. I specialise in inclusive design and accessibility: making things that everyone can use, regardless of their device, the network they’re on, or any disabilities they might have.
