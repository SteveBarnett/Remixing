Hi, I’m Steve Barnett.

I tend to be quite reflective. Here's [a short review of my 2023](/review/2023/), and [my ongoing focus for 2024](/themes/2024).

And here's what I've been up to the past few months: [August](/2024/08/), [September](/2024/09/), [October](/2024/10/), [November](/2024/11/).

## Personal

I like **reading** for fun and for learning. I keep a [reading list](/reading/) here (and on [my goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/max_barners)). I try to read widely, but I particularly like sci-fi, psychology, and (several flavours of) philosophy. I often [write up my notes on index cards](/notes/) to help me summarise and remember the content. Things I want to keep considering I also write up in [my thinking section](/thinking/), in a digital [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book)-like format.

I like making **pictures**, with cameras or pens and pencils. Often abstract, strange juxtapositions, or iconography and patterns. I go by the nickname Max Barners. [See some of my photos on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/maxbarners/). [I like to sketch and draw](/art/), especially in small and weird ways.

I occasionally run small ["events"](/eventing/) for small(ish) groups of friends. I'm one of the organisers for [One Mindful Breath](https://www.onemindfulbreath.org.nz/), a secular dharma practice community in Wellington, Aotearoa New Zealand.
  
## Work

I make **websites**. More specifically: I’m a human-centered front-end developer and user experience designer. I specialise in inclusive design and accessibility: making things that everyone can use, regardless of their device, the network they’re on, or any disabilities they might have.
