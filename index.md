Hi, I’m Steve Barnett. Here are some of the things I do.

I tend to be quite reflective. Here's [a short review of my 2022](/review/2022/). Here's [what I've been up to this month](/this-month/) and [last month](/last-month).

## Personal

I like **reading** for fun and for learning. Around the start of 2018 I started tracking what I read on [my goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/max_barners). I keep [a copy of the list here](/reading/). I try to read widely, but I particularly like sci-fi, psychology, and (several flavours of) philosophy. I often [write up my notes on index cards](/notes/) to help me summarise and remember the content. Things I want to keep considering I also write up as one-liners in [a digital-Zettelkasten-like thing](/thinking/).

I like making **pictures**, with cameras or pens and pencils. Often abstract, strange juxtapositions, or iconography and patterns. I go by the nickname Max Barners. [See some of my photos on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/maxbarners/). [I like to sketch and draw](/art/), especially in small and weird ways.

I like making and listening to **music**. I made themed playlists for a series of "house parties for grown ups" (start early, dance a lot, finish early). The mixes live at [my profile on Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/MaxBarners/). I tinker with making electronic music using Ableton Live and [post the music here](/music/) and to [my SoundCloud profile](https://soundcloud.com/maxbarners).
  
## Work

I make **websites**. More specifically: I’m a human-centered front-end developer and user experience designer. I specialise in inclusive design and accessibility: making things that everyone can use, regardless of their device, the network they’re on, or any disabilities they might have.
