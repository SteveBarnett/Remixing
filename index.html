<p>Hi, I’m Steve Barnett. Here are some of the things I do.</p>

<h2>Personal</h2>

<p>
  I
  <strong>read</strong>
  quite a bit. Around the start of 2018 I started tracking what I read on
  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/max_barners">my goodreads profile</a>.
  I tend to read sci-fi, psychology, philosophy, and work books. I often
  <a href="/notes/">write up my notes on index cards</a> to help me
  summarise and remember the content.
</p>

<p>
  I like taking
  <strong>pictures</strong>. Of cats, dogs, and other odd things. Often
  abstract or strange juxtapositions. I go by the nickname Max Barners.

    >See some of my photos on Instagram</a
  >. Sometimes <a href="/art/">I like to sketch and draw</a>, especially in
  small and weird ways.
</p>

<p>
  I like
  <strong>music</strong>. I made themed playlists for a series of "house
  parties for grown ups" (start early, dance a lot, finish early). The mixes
  live at
  <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/MaxBarners/">my profile on Mixcloud</a>.
  I tinker with making electronic music using Ableton Live and <a href="/music/">post the music here</a> and to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/maxbarners">my SoundCloud profile</a>.
</p>
    
<h2>Work</h2>

<p>
  I make web sites. More specifically: I’m a human-centered front-end
  developer and user experience designer.
