title: Layers
---

Reality is processes and fields that collapse into "things." We can draw a (fairly arbitrary) line around a group of processes or fields and call it a system. We can draw (fairly arbitrary) lines in a system to create layers.

- **Each layer influences, and is influenced by, its neighbours.** The layers are distinct, but not divided. They're interconnected and interdependent.
- **Each layer offers a change in context, scale, and/or extent.** Each layer is worth reviewing on its own.
- **The zoomed-out layers are bigger; they move and change more slowly.** All the layers are in constant motion. 
- **The faster layers get our attention, but the slower layers have the power.** Slow and big controls fast and small by constraint and constancy. Fast and small instructs slow and big by accrued innovation and occasional revolution. The faster layers learn, the slower layers remember.
