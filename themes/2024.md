Off the back of [a review of the year](/thinking/2023-year-in-review/), and some thinking about [my bigger picture philosophy](/thinking/my-philosophy/), I scribbled a big buncha notes.

## Practice

My theme for 2024 is going to (try and) be **rest**.

> "I well get more rest, be more at rest, and leave the rest aside."

Resting and relaxing is something I have not been doing very well during 2023.

Some things that I find relaxing:

<div id="mcswarm" class="boxout">
<p>meditating, cooking, sketching, walking, arting, reading, music(k?)ing.</p>
</div>

I know that part of me does want to rest, to relax. I find "close your eyes" instructions in a meditation session very easy, quick, pleasing. I often find I gently resist the "open your eyes" instructions at the end of a session: I want to stay sitting there, eyes closed, resting and relaxing.

## Philosophy

I keep finding myself being drawn back to **Zen** and **Daoism**. I'm going to dig more deeply into Zen this year, leaning more towards it than psychology or philosophy or nonduality or Buddhism more broadly.

I'll be focusing on (what I will call pig) Zen:

<div class="boxout" markdown="1">
- Health (engaging and unifying body and mind);
- Art (creating in a wholehearted, flow, state);
- Mindfulness (the sacredness of ordinary, everyday, acts).
</div>

I'm keeping notes from reading at [thinking/Zen](/thinking/zen/).

## Tracker

A short record of what I've done, and what I plan to do next.

I'm aiming for a specific topic for each month, to keep myself focused.

### January

- Rest
	- Trying longer sits.
- Health: flexibility.
	- Wing Chun stretches.
- Art: music.
	- Making longer, ambient-style, bits of music.
- Mindfulness: sacredness of the everyday.
	- Studying the basics of Zen: a bunch of introduction, instruction, and overview books.
		- Zazen form: sit like a mountain; open eyes, downcast gaze.
	- Cleaning up the kitchen immediately after cooking, before eating.
	- Making the bed immediately after getting up.

#### January end of month check-in

I did well with these, apart from the Art / music. I only made one track. I had a fun doing it, though, so I'm going to carry this over to February.

I've enjoyed studying and implementing Zen things. I have a handful more books that are introduction-like, so I'm going to carry this over to February too.

### February

- Rest
	- Learning and cooking some new recipes.
- Health
	- More frequent walking, preferably in nature.
	- Wing Chun exercises.
	- Running.
- Art
	- Making longer, ambient-style, bits of music.
	- Sketching people, especially countours of groups, outlines.
- Mindfulness
	- Continue studying (and immediately putting into practice) the basics of Zen.
	- Being more mindful at work.

#### February end of month check-in

I didn't do so well this month. I didn't do any sketching, and only made one music track. I managed to read a few books, though, including a couple of good Zen ones. I started, and am still, running and am enjoying it a lot.

I'm going to try and be more specific with some of March goals. I often find that helps.

### March

- Rest
	- Book a week off in March or April.
	- Start a (re)readthrough of Iain M. Banks' Culture books.
- Health
	- Keep on running, three times a week.
	- ~~Keep up Wing Chun exercises, four times a week.~~
- Art
	- Make four longer, ambient-style, bits of music.
	- ~~Join one Urban Sketchers meetup.~~
- Mindfulness
	- Work through [Henry Shukman's The Way app](https://www.thewayapp.com/).
	- Read a bunch of Thich Nhat Hanh books.
	- ~~Do one seaside sit each weekend.~~

#### March end of month check-in

A bit mixed, but I'm happy with how it went. In particular, I got a lot from focusing on Thich Nhat Hanh books and (re)discovering how he talks about interbeing.

#### April end of month check-in

Pretty good! Weekend and a week away were both really good for resting. Did lots of reading for fun. Health went well. I did a little bit of sketching and arting and enjoyed it. Did lots of mindfulness things: a solo and a group retreat; revisited my philosophy, read some great books. Prepared and gave a lightning talk, did some good work on the one day workshop. Started a new job that's fully remote work; keeping an eye on myself with that.

### May

- **Work**
	- ✔ Settle into new job.
	- Prepare one day workshop (June).

#### May end of month check-in

**Rest** went well. I found it fairly easy to relax. Maybe because I'm tired.

**Health** was good, but I stopped running when the weather snapped cold, and then went a bit hibernate-y. That was okay for a few weeks, but I want to get back into it, do more than just big walks.

**Art** was very patchy. Very little in the way of drawing or music. That's okay.

**Mindfulness** was great. Some good reading and thinking and things. The final week, taking a "break" to Just Sit was good.

**Work** was good. New job is great! It's fast-paced, but I'm finding it... relaxing. Still tired, though! Still lots of new stuff.

### June

I may have be a bit overindexing on the M of my [Zen HAM](#philosophy). For June, I'm going to try and focus more on Health and Art. I'll mostly take Dharma-related reading more slowly this month. When I would usually read, I might do a big sit, [shikantaza](/thinking/zen/shikantaza/)-style, [just sitting](/thinking/zen/the-just-in-just-sitting/), or make some music. Then maybe read a little afterwards.

- **Rest**
	- ✔ Continue (re)readthrough of Iain M. Banks' Culture books
- **Health**
	- Get back into it! Prioritise health over time.
	- Think about "seasonal exercising".
	- Running, on days that the weather is double digits.
	- Exercises.
- **Art**
	- Urban Sketchpomorphisation
	- Make some "melodic techno" (Feeling groovy after listening to some [TribalNeed](https://tribalneed.bandcamp.com/music). Techno is not usually my thing, but this guy is great!)
- **Mindfulness**
	- ✔ Continue draft of a [Spectrum of Awareness](/thinking/the-spectrum-of-awareness/) session for OMB
	- ✔ Sit with [Original Nature by Henry Shukman on the Waking Up app](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/pack/PKCC68C?code=SC541514D&share_id=60FFB824&source=content%20share) (6 sessions of 30m)
	- ✔ Read some books on Korean Zen ([some bookedmarked books](https://pinboard.in/u:maxbarners/t:koreanzen/)).
- **Work**
	- ✔ Prepare [one day workshop](https://naga.co.za/workshops/2024/nztc/)

#### June end of month check-in

- **Rest**. Went pretty well. Finished reading all the Culture books.
- **Health**. Did not go so well. Couldn't get back into it.
- **Art**. Did not go so well, but I don't feel too bad about it.
- **Mindfulness**. Went well. Co-ran a session at OMB. Read a bunch of Korean Zen. Finding some peace taking a wider perspective.
- **Work**. Went well. Prepared and ran a workshop a one day workshop.

My plans for June didn't work out as... planned. The OMB session and the work workshop took up a lot of time and space, and that left me with little energy for much else. Some stuff is carrying forward.

#### August end of month check-in

- Oof. Bit of a rough month, mostly from stressing about Roxy. 
- I'm feeling a bit of fatigue. Definitely some physical fatigue from not sleeping well. but also mental fatigue from this long stretch of one-topic study. My practice feels pretty alive and fresh, after some updates. But the study feels stretched. Perhaps a year is a bit too long, and a quarter is a better horizon for me. Or running with the seasons. Or, like other things, have a bit more of a plan from the start. Light structure, with room to wiggle.

#### September end of month check-in

It went okay! Read a bit about death and it made me feel better. Reading a Joan Tollifson book made me feeling (more) at peace with the (im)perfection of where I am and with how things are. I didn't do some of the things on my Mindfulness list, but I did others, so that's fine. Health was fine this month, but I didn't get back into exercising at all. Enjoyed helping run a retreat. Feeling good about OMB.
