Off the back of [a review of the year](/thinking/2023-year-in-review/), and some thinking about [my bigger picture philosophy](/thinking/my-philosophy/), I scribbled a big buncha notes.

## Practice

My theme for 2024 is going to (try and) be **rest**.

> "I well get more rest, be more at rest, and leave the rest aside."

Resting and relaxing is something I have not been doing very well during 2023.

Some things that I find relaxing: meditating, cooking, sketching, walking, arting, reading, music(k?)ing.

I know that part of me does want to rest, to relax. I find "close your eyes" instructions in a meditation session very easy, quick, pleasing. I often find I gently resist the "open your eyes" instructions at the end of a session: I want to stay sitting there, eyes closed, resting and relaxing.

## Philosophy

I keep finding myself being drawn back to **Zen** and **Daoism**. I'm going to dig more deeply into Zen this year, leaning more towards it than psychology or philosophy or nonduality or Buddhism more broadly.

I'll be focusing on (what I will call pig) Zen:

<div class="boxout" markdown="1">
- Health (engaging and unifying body and mind);
- Art (creating in a wholehearted, flow, state);
- Mindfulness (the sacredness of ordinary, everyday, acts).
</div>

I'm keeping notes from reading at [thinking/Zen](/thinking/zen/).

## Tracker

A short record of what I've done, and what I plan to do next.

I'm aiming for a specific topic for each month, to keep myself focused.

### January

- Rest
	- Trying longer sits.
- Health: flexibility.
	- Wing Chun stretches.
- Art: music.
	- Making longer, ambient-style, bits of music.
- Mindfulness: sacredness of the everyday.
	- Studying the basics of Zen: a bunch of introduction, instruction, and overview books.
		- Zazen form: sit like a mountain; open eyes, downcast gaze.
	- Cleaning up the kitchen immediately after cooking, before eating.
	- Making the bed immediately after getting up.

#### January end of month check-in

I did well with these, apart from the Art / music. I only made one track. I had a fun doing it, though, so I'm going to carry this over to February.

I've enjoyed studying and implementing Zen things. I have a handful more books that are introduction-like, so I'm going to carry this over to February too.

### February

- Rest
	- Learning and cooking some new recipes.
- Health
	- More frequent walking, preferably in nature.
	- Wing Chun exercises.
	- Running.
- Art
	- Making longer, ambient-style, bits of music.
	- Sketching people, especially countours of groups, outlines.
- Mindfulness
	- Continue studying (and immediately putting into practice) the basics of Zen.
	- Being more mindful at work.

#### February end of month check-in

I didn't do so well this month. I didn't do any sketching, and only made one music track. I managed to read a few books, though, including a couple of good Zen ones. I started, and am still, running and am enjoying it a lot.

I'm going to try and be more specific with some of March goals. I often find that helps.

### March

- Rest
	- Book a week off in March or April.
	- Start a (re)readthrough of Iain M. Banks' Culture books.
- Health
	- Keep on running, three times a week.
	- ~~Keep up Wing Chun exercises, four times a week.~~
- Art
	- Make four longer, ambient-style, bits of music.
	- ~~Join one Urban Sketchers meetup.~~
- Mindfulness
	- Work through [Henry Shukman's The Way app](https://www.thewayapp.com/).
	- Read a bunch of Thich Nhat Hanh books.
	- ~~Do one seaside sit each weekend.~~

#### March end of month check-in

A bit mixed, but I'm happy with how it went. In particular, I got a lot from focusing on Thich Nhat Hanh books and (re)discovering how he talks about interbeing.

Pretty good! Weekend and a week away were both really good for resting. Did lots of reading for fun. Health went well. I did a little bit of sketching and arting and enjoyed it. Did lots of mindfulness things: a solo and a group retreat; revisited my philosophy, read some great books. Prepared and gave a lightning talk, did some good work on the one day workshop. Started a new job that's fully remote work; keeping an eye on myself with that.
