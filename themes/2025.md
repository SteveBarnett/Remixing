## Intro

Theme. Taste. Flavour. Theme as [stance, direction](/thinking/direction-word-salad/).

My [theme for last year](/theme/2024) was "rest". It [didn't go so well](/review/2024/#by-the-themes). However, I did pull together a bunch of different thought and stances into ["The Three Uhds" and "LSD"](#whittled-practices-to-stay-on-the-path) that I found pretty [fruitful](/thinking/fruitful/) and [useful](/thinking/useful-word-salad/).

<div markdown="1" class="boxout-light"> 
My theme for 2025 is going to (try and) be **acceptance**.<br>
I will (try and) be **more accepting of more things**.
</div>

- It's not about giving up, but it is about yielding.
- It's not about ignoring bad things, but it is about being more clear about how bad they are, or if they really are bad.
- It's aligned with the (humanistic psychologist) Carl Rogers' stance of acceptance being required for change, and with [Tara Brach's Radical Acceptance](https://www.tarabrach.com/books/radical-acceptance/) ([my notes](/notes/tara-brach/radical acceptance and its radical impact - tara brach.jpg)).
    - It's about taking care.

## Gates: WHIP

Gates for practice this year are **W**ork, **H**ealth, **I**nterests (new name for [art](/art), creative stuff, hobbies), **P**ractice.

- **W**ork
    - Write at least one thing a month
    - Talk and/or facilitate something a few times in the year
- **H**ealth
    - Keep doing lots of walking
    - Get back into more serious exercise
    - More healthy drinking and eating
    - Socialising (health is not just physical)
- <span id="interests">**I**nterests</span>
    - Drawing, maybe sketching
    - Reading
    - Music: get back into learning to play the (smol) piano
    - Cooking
    - Gardening, inside and outside
- **P**ractice.
    - Meditating, at least once a day
    - Zen still feels like a good fit, so I'm going to keep going with it. I'm using [The Way app](https://www.thewayapp.com/) for my morning sits, and [Waking Up](https://www.wakingup.com/) more generally. I still have plenty of Zen books on the (physical and virtual) shelves. I'll probably meander in and out of it a bit more this year, though.
    - Track Valued Action in daily reflections
    - One Mindful Breath stuff: Janitorial duties (IRL and online), finding facilitators, facilitating.

### Other things to maybe do

- Figuring out how I can / if I want to channel the energy from some of my patterns:
    - Poker (inquisitive, analytic)
    - Remixer
    - Pragmatic ([useful, helpful, fruitful, etc](/thinking/useful-word-salad/))
- Have another go around at [koan practice](/thinking/zen/zen-koans/). Dig deeper into [shikantaza](/thinking/zen/shikantaza/) / [just sitting](/thinking/zen/the-just-in-just-sitting/).

### Self-fulfilling activity

- Just do the thing, nothing else.
- No "in order to". Do the thing for the simple delight of doing it.
- Free of goals and outcomes, like play.

## Valued Action: POCK

Continued recommitment to aligning my actions with my values. A triangle of three with acceptance in the middle are POCK: **P**atient, **O**pen, **C**lear, **K**ind. These aren't the only things that are important. They are the ones I want to focus on.

- [Kind(ness) is the root for me](/thinking/valued-action-for-january-2024/), the thing that underlies it all.
- Patient is the most important one for Acceptance. It's the thing I'm worst at. So... this year I'm trying to be more patient with my impatience. This is a bit of [a paradox](/thinking/paradoxes/) conceptually, but not experientially.
- POCK is partly aspirational, and partly a lens to examine deeply who I am, and the ways in which I don't to live up to the values. "Slowly, painfully, reconcile to life."
- It's admittedly a bit circular and self-referential. The Acceptance Practice is using POCK as gates to Acceptance.

### Two chonky things to apply these to

- Restlessness
    - Accepting it when I can, and noticing it when I can't. Waiting a moment.
    - Applying Redirects (Implementation Intention / habit type things) in an Antifragile way: avoiding things that don't work, rather than looking for things that do.
    - Linking to hiding, avoidance
    - Considering Non-restlessness, refraining from restlessness, being more still
- Roxyâ€™s old age
    - What I can do
    - What I can't do

## Practices to stay on the Path

These are whittled version of practices, using [my pattern / skillset](/thinking/my-pattern-skillset-research-remix-replay/) of Research, Remix, Reply.

- Catch it early? [LSD](/thinking/lsd/) (Listen (centre, edges, changes), Slow your tempo, doubt)
- Catch it late? [The three uhds](/thinking/the-three-uhds/) (Should, Could, Good)
    - Let go of the idea that "this isn't it"

I also really like [RAIN](/thinking/wider-rain-practice/) (Recognise, Allow, Investigate, Nurture), but... I find it very difficult to do the Nurture step. For now at least, other practices have a bit more traction for me.

## Tracker

A short record of what Iâ€™ve done, and what I plan to do next.

Iâ€™m aiming for a specific topic for each month, to keep myself focused.

#### End of month review (January)

Roxy's sleep has tanked hard in the past few weeks, and it's really messing with my sleep too. "Sundowner syndrome" ([in humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundowning) and [in dogs](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/dog-dementia/)]), apparently, pretty common with brain-related decline. It's pretty rough.

- **Work.** Snuck in a blog post at the last minute! Tried doing some Patience-related things at work, going well!
- **Health.** Okay la, Slowly getting back into it. Bit of a dip in walking over the break, but back into now.
- **Interests.** Did a whack of [Japan-related research](/japan/), then realised it was stressing me out, so took a pause. Still enjoying Libby: I like the surprise when something I put a hold on weeks ago appears in my inbox. Dipping in and out of video games, but not finding much that feels fun to play.
- **Practice.** Building up pace again for more Zen reading and sitting. Having a bit of a flurry of writing. Using it as a way of iteratively working through ideas. Still sitting almost every morning, and some evenings. Doing... okay with Patience. Not bad, but not good either.

Plan for February: keep on keepin' on. Just chipping away at things and not pushing too hard.
