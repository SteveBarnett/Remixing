## List of ideas

HIP: **H**ealth, **I**nterests (new name for art, creative stuff), **P**ractice.

- From [last year's review](/review/2024/)
    - Health
    - Restlessness
    - Roxyâ€™s old age
- Restlessness
    - Coming to terms with
    - Avoiding things that don't work, rather than looking for things that do
    - Link to hiding, avoidance
    - Redirects
    - Non-restlessness, refraining from restlessness, being more still.
- Okay.
    - As in fundamental okayness. Everything is basically okay.
    - As in acceptance.
    - As in good enough ordinary life.
- Loose, Open, Peaceful
- Support, Service, Help
- Figuring out how I can / if I want to channel the energy from some of my patterns:
    - Poker (inquisitive, analytic)
    - Remixer
    - Pragmatic ([useful, helpful, fruitful, etc](/thinking/useful-word-salad/))

## The Path

- The three levels (ride the waves, calm the waves, be the waves) (psychology to philosophy)
- [The three uhds](/thinking/the-three-uhds/) (Should, Could, Good)
    - Let go of the idea that "this isn't it"
- [LSD](/thinking/lsd/) (Listen, Slow your tempo, doubt)
- [RAIN](/thinking/wider-rain-practice/) (Recognise, Allow, Investigate, Nurture)
    - What are trying to protect yourself from?
    - What are you numbing or distracting yourself from?
    - If you dropped the story you're adding, what would you be doing instead?
