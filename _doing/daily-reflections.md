### What is it?

At the end of every day sit down and reflect.

- What happened that day?
- What are your grateful for?
- How are you doing with habits (old and new)?
- What did you do well?
- What did you do not so well?
- What will you do differently, based on these reflections?

I find I'm more of a morning person, so I do this each morning looking back at the previous day. I also find it useful to look back at the end of each week, each month, and each year.

### Why is it important?

I believe that "the unexamined life is not worth living". We can learn a lot by reflecting. We can use that information to inform our future choices and decisions: use it as wake-up call where necessary, and enjoy successes when they occur.
