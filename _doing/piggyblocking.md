elevator-pitch: Establish a new habit more easily by putting it between two existing habits.
---

### What is it?

1. **Piggyback** it. More sensibly called Habit Stacking. Do the new habit immediately **after** an existing habit.
2. Make it a **blocker**. More sensibly called Temptation Bundling. Do the new habit immediately **before** an existing habit. Pair a want to with a have to. Link the reward with the action that you want to take.

For best results, combine these two: piggyblock it.

### Why is it important?

Establishing new habits is hard. Set yourself up for success by shaping the path / changing the environment / nudging from two sides.
