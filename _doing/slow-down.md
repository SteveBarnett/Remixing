### What is it?

Take a moment before speaking or acting.

### Why is it important?

When we slow down, we can:

- respond rather than react. Intensity and reactivity breed more of the same.
- see more clearly: see things as they are, see ourselves as we are.
- pay more attention. The more attention we put on something, the more meaning it has.
- have time to reflect. Reflection is where we cement learning.
- listen more attentively and actively. Really hear what's being said.
