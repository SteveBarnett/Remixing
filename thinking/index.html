<p>These are some ideas that make me stop and think. They change how I think about things and how I try to be in the world. They help me be a better person. For me that means being a better friend, partner, teacher, professional, creative.</p>

<p>Like most things, the pages here are "Work In Progress." But <a href="/thinking/wip/">the ones marked WIP</a> are more explicitly still in draft form.
