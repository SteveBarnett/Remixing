- We know that there are better and worse things to spend money on.
- Ads sell high ideas, virtues, human flourishing. But they provide material good that often don't supply that.
- It's immensely hard to like things that aren't glamorous.
- **Economics *could* be concerned with individual and collective flourishing.**
	- **"Right profit" from helping people lead better lives**, putting money into education, social impact, human progress.
- Price is not a good indicator of value, worth.
- We need to change the perception, judgement, of low-paid work.
- **The measure of a society is how it treats its unluckiest members.**
	- Hospitals, transport, schools should be great, especially for those on lower incomes.
