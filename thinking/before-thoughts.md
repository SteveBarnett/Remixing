title: Before thoughts
---

Thoughts are important. But they are additions on top of what is, and on top of who we are. The truth of reality, and of our self, is before thoughts, not beyond them.

There's a gap between experiencing and thinking. At first the gap is very small. Thoughts come rushing in very quickly, almost in the same instant. With practice, we can make that gap a little wider.

We can't stop thoughts from rushing in. Producing thoughts is just what the mind does. But we can slow it down a bit.
