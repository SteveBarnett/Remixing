A quick summary of some things from this year, poking through [the 2023 archives](/2023/).

## By the numbers

- Wrote nearly 500 "thinking" one-liners from books and videos.
- Wrote 25 "collections" (gathering the one-liners up and sometimes adding a bit extra).
- Wrote about 30 longer form bits (more writing, less one-line-ing).
- Made notes on about 40 books.
- Read 119 books (!).
- Made just 2 new music tracks.
- Played 21 games.

## By the themes

- Discovered some new really great authors: Byung-Chul Han (philosophy); Adrian Tchikovsky (sci-fi); Ken Wilber (philosophy); Charlotte Joko Beck (Zen).
- Thought and wrote a lot about Buddhism, especially Zen.
- Thought and write a lot about Daoism.
- Continued exploring nonduality.
- Did a fair amount of arting, but it tailed off as the year went on.
- Thought a lot about acceptance and critic vs coach.

## Media

### Games

Apparently I like Soulslikes now! Famously difficult, but rewarding of effort and exploration. More on that later perhaps...

- Dark Souls 3 on PS5. Intricate, exciting, dark fantasy world.
- Armoured Core 6 on PS5. High speed big shooty robot action!
- Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice on PS5. Mythical Japanese shinobi rhythmic swordplay.
- The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom on Nintendo Switch. Incredible remix / remake / expansion of Breath of the Wild.
- Sifu on PS5. Fast and incredibly stylish kung-fu fighting.
- Yakuza: Like a Dragon on PS5. Absolutely bonkers turn-based JRPG.
