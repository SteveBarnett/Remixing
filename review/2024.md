A quick summary of some things from this year, poking through [the 2023 archives](/2023/).

## By the numbers

- Ran [two solo sessions and one joint session](/thinking/2024/#omb) for [One Mindful Breath](https://www.onemindfulbreath.org.nz/).
- Holidays. Melbourne in October. Nelson in April.

## By the themes

- Started off strong on the "Rest" theme, but... tailed off after a few months. Although I kept up with many of my [MCSWARM things](/themes/2024/#mcswarm), it felt like the impact, the amount of battery recharged, dropped off as the year went on.
    - Notable: did no art stuff from June onwards.
- Really got a lot from spending a whole year with Zen as a main focus.
- Carried on fiddling with [my take on Internal Family Systems](/thinking/2024/#ifs).
- In April 2024 started at Intopia as a Digital Accessibility Consultant. I was not a good fit for that team at MSD. My approach and attitude was almost opposite to some key members.

## Books

Surprising no-one, I read quite a lot of books this year. About 8 books a month (How is that even possibleâ€½).

Here are some of my top reads from the year.

### Fiction

- The Bloody Chamber and Other Stories by Carter, Angela.
- Liars by Manguso, Sarah. Oof. Manguso writes so well and precisely and painfully.
- Menewood by Griffith, Nicola. I loved Hild and this was equally good in a different way.

I also read all of Iain M. Banks Culture novels. So good! And a few that were new to me.

### Nonfiction

- Zen and the Art of Saving the Planet by Hanh, Thich Nhat. Such clear, insightful, thinking, as in all his books.
- No Bad Parts by Schwartz, Richard C. I'm not all-in on IFS, but "parts" is useful way of bundling bits together.
- Painting the Sidewalk with Water by Tollifson, Joan. A real find for me. Her books and Substack are so good, insightful, helpful.
