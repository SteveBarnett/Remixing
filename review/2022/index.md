title: My 2022 in review
layout: page
---

Some things I learned:

- working at a corporate is not a good fit for me, **but/and** it's a good opportunity for me to keeping bringing things back to the human, to advocate for incremental and iterative approaches, and for using the carrot not the stick;
- taking holidays is more important than I think, **but/and** the details are less important than I think;
- I am (still) very conflict-avoidant, **but/and** I've learned to speak up more when I'm unhappy;
- I'm regularly grateful for my (meditation and mindfulness) practice;
- Daoism is very much my jam (see my [notes](/notes/#daoism), [thinking](/thinking/all/#daoism), and [doing](/doing/all/#daoism).

My favourite new place this year was [New Plymouth](https://www.newzealand.com/au/new-plymouth/).

Overall, this has been a quite a quiet year, **but/and** things are good.

## Media

I read some great books and played some great games in 2022. Here are my top 5s, in no particular order.

### Books: fiction

- [A Prayer for the Crown-Shy by Becky Chambers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40864030-a-prayer-for-the-crown-shy). Short, beautiful, wonder-full.
- [Spear by Nicola Griffith](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58032826-spear). Chunky, deep, lyrical.
- [The Kaiju Preservation Society by John Scalzi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59588796-the-kaiju-preservation-society). Silly, funny, fast.
- [A Memory Called Empire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57723963-a-memory-called-empire) and [A Desolation Called Peace](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55585233-a-desolation-called-peace) by Arkady Martine. Creative, amazing, expansive.
- [Flights by Olga Tokarczuk, Jennifer Croft](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35165929-flights). Subtle, graceful, glancing.

### Books: non-fiction

- [Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19363412-radical-acceptance). Practical, useful, but/and beautiful book that gives me help where I really need it.
- [Supersense by John Downer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3230733-supersense). Really brings home the idea that perception is particpation.
- [The Matter With Things by Iain McGilchrist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59577089-the-matter-with-things). A gargantuan beast that brings together lots of things into one epic journey.
- [Losing Ourselves by Jay L. Garfield](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61146136-losing-ourselves). Very thought-provoking discussion of the nature of self as a series of overlapping processes.
- [Li: Dynamic Form in Nature by David G. Wade](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/316280.Li). Beautiful little book highlighting the patterns on, in, and under everything.
- [Crystal and Dragon by David G. Wade](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/363920.Crystal_and_Dragon). A thoughtful, scientific, mystical, look at form and energy.

### Games

- [Xenoblade Chronicles 3](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/xenoblade-chronicles-3-switch/) on Switch. Massive, beautiful, JRPG.
- [Neon White](https://neonwhite.rip/) on Switch. Speed-running, but fun. Perfectly pitched learning curve.
- [Paradise Killer](http://paradisekiller.com/) on Switch. 90s-flavoured murder mystery with amazing music.
- [Pok√©mon Legends: Arceus](https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/) on Switch. Open world, open-handed, at last!
- [Elden Ring](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring) on PS4. Just wow. Massive, deep, light-touch, difficult open world. A Fromsoftware game that I can actually play!
