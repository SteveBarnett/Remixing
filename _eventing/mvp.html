<h2>Past themes</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>90s Eurotrash.</strong> Pop club electronic dancefloor earworms of the 90s.</li>
	<li><strong>Glitter and Sequins.</strong> All the Queen and Bowie and Elton John we can squeeze into one playlist with a supporting cast identified by their propensity for Sparkly Things and Epicness.</li>
	<li><strong>Rollin' 50s.</strong> Mostly Rock and Roll with a bit of Doo-Wah and Bee-Bop and other noises people in the 50s clearly made while singing. Think Mr Sandman's Blue Suede Shoes! </li>
	<li><strong>(Alt-ish) Grrrock.</strong> The theme is GRRROCK (GiRl ROCK!), continuing with the ladies but now on the alternative, rock-and-roll, slam your guitar at things side. Expect to RockIt!</li>
	<li><strong>Noughty Divas.</strong> The theme is DIVAS: larger than life, fabulous, towering Goddesses of Pop. The genre is TOO LARGE to fit into one little 2 hour party, so expect contemporary icons like Beyonce, Katy Perry and Taylor Swift.</li>
	<li><strong>Hairy Metal.</strong> An intersection between Hair Rock and Heavy metal (that's a lot more hairy than metallic!). This is let your hair down and swing it all around kind of music, there'll be a mosh-pit in the pool.</li>
	<li><strong>Stayin' Dancing.</strong> The music of queens, mammas, and chances. The music of alive, deep love, and fever. The music of chic, kool, summers	It's disco, mirrorballers.</li>
	<li><strong>Tarantinish.</strong> It'll be music from the movies of Quentin Tarantino (think Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, From Dusk Till Dawn, Kill Bill, Jackie Brown, Death Proof) and stuff that sounds like it could be have been in one of his movies. There'll be 50s and 60s and rock and roll and doo wop and funk and soul and surf rock. And more! ðŸ˜„</li>
	<li><strong>Oh god, the 80s.</strong> Ah, yes. Finally, the moment has come: We are doing 80s pop and rock. Will it be quality? Will it be cheesy? Will it be quality cheese? Yes. </li>
	<li><strong>Kinda funky.</strong> Funk! With a little bit of disco and soul thrown in there.</li>
	<li><strong>6s and 7s rock.</strong> Pop n rock n roll and things. Sounds of the 60s and 70s (with little sprinkles of other decades too). You will Roll some Stones, shake out some Kinks, ask Who, have some Beatle juice, and more! \o/</li>
	<li><strong>Cheesy Whiplash.</strong> Mashups!</li>
	<li><strong>The Latin Lick.</strong> Latin(o) rhythms and grooves, with samba and jazz sprinkles. Think Carnival, Cuba, and Cumbia. :)</li>
	<li><strong>Gypsy Jump.</strong> Gypsy balkan big brass fusion! Yes, that's a thing. :D</li>
	<li><strong>Rocky.</strong> Various flavours of people with rock-y guitars. That means: Bed on Bricks, The Black Keys, Franz Ferdinand, The Fratellis, The Hives, Kaiser Chiefs, and more.</li>
	<li><strong>Electroswing.</strong></li>
</ul>
