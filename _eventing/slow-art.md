- Decide on a group of 3 or 4 friends, and an art gallery to visit. It works best with a small gallery or choosing just a few rooms from a big gallery.
- **Stroll around for about 10 or 15 minutes and pick one piece of art each.**
	- Check you've all picked something different!
- Take turns around the group.
	- Go the piece of art the person has picked.
	- **Look at it for in silence for 10 minutes.**
		- The chooser keeps an eye on the clock. What works well is a silent, buzzing, alarm set on a phone.
		- Feel free to move around!
	- **Have a short discussion about the art and your experience.**
		- What did you see later that you didn't see earlier?
		- Did the time feel long or short?
- **Retire to a nearby cafe and discuss the art and the experience a little longer.**
