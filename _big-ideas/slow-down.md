title: Slow down
---

### What is it?

Taking a moment before speaking or acting.

### Why is it important?

Slowing down lets you respond rather than react. Intensity and reactivity breed more of the same.

Moving more slowly lets you see more clearly. See things as they are. See yourself as you are.

It lets you pay more attention. The more attention you put on something, the more meaning it has.

Slowing down gives you time to reflect. Reflection is where learning happens.
