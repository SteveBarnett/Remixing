### What is it?

Mindset is about a person's behaviour, specifically in relation to failures and difficulties. 

- A person with a **fixed mindset** believes that skills are innate and that failure is the end. Think "I'm just not good at maths." They believe that success should be easy.
- A person with a **growth mindset** believes that skills can be learned and that failure is an opportunity for learning and growing. Think: "I'm not good at maths *yet*". They believe that success comes from applied effort.

### Why is it important?

Having a growth mindset can make a huge difference to resilience, happiness, and the ability to learn new skills.
		
Seeing setbacks as challenges reduces the emotional cost and increases your chances of finding a workaround.
