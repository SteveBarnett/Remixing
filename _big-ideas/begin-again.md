### What is it?

There's always a choice: do we want to follow this next thought, get carried away by it? Or do we want to choose to drop the story we've been telling ourselves so far? Sometimes it feels more difficult than others, but the choice is always there.

### Why is it important?

When we can begin again, it can entirely change our experience of an interaction, and the outcome. By beginning again we can recentre on the present, which is all there really is.

- In the middle of an argument, you can catch yourself, and begin again.
- After spending a few hours being lost in thought, you can catch yourself, and begin again.
