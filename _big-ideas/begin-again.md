title: Begin Again
---

### What is it?

At every point in our lives there's always a choice: do we want to follow this next thought, get carried away by it? We can always choose to drop the story we've been telling ourselves so far. We can begin again with a fresh, open-hearted, perspective. Sometimes it feels more difficult than others, but the choice, the chance, is always there.


### Why is it important?

When you can begin again, it can entirely change your experience, and the outcome, of an interaction. In the middle of an argument, you can catch yourself, and begin again. After spending a few hours being list in thought, you can catch yourself, and begin again.

The past is gone and the future doesn't exist. By beginning again we can recentre on the present, which is all there really is.
