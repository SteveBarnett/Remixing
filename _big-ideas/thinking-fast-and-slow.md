title: Thinking, Fast and Slow
---

### What is it?

We have two modes of thought:

- **System 1** that's **fast**, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic, unconscious.
- **System 2** that's **slow**, effortful, infrequent, logical, calculating, conscious.

Things in System 2 take up a lot of energy, so the brain tries to put things in System 1. The problem comes when things that maybe shouldn't be in System 1 are put there, leading to (many, many!) cognitive biases.

### Why is it important?

Being aware of the fact that we take constant mental shortcuts can help us spot our biases and not act on them. We can do this by consciously pushing things into System 2, the slow system, and thinking through things (or re-thinking) rather than jumping to conclusions.

It's also a reminder than most things aren't binary: they exist on a spectrum. They might be in categories, but they have fuzzy edges.

For teaching and learning, it's a good reminder that different is better than same. KEep mixing things up to keep people's brains active and engaged.

For philosophy it can be reminder that it's your judgement about a thing that upsets, not the thing itself.
