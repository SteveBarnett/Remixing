elevator-pitch: The brain puts things into a fast / unconscious category or a slow / conscious category.

### What is it?

We have two modes of thought:

- **System 1** that's **fast**, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic, unconscious.
- **System 2** that's **slow**, effortful, infrequent, logical, calculating, conscious.

Things in the slow system take up a lot of energy, so the brain tries to put things in the fast system. The problem comes when things that maybe shouldn't be in the fast system are put there, leading to (many, many!) cognitive biases.

### Why is it important?

Being aware of the fact that we take constant mental shortcuts can help us spot our biases and not act on them. We can do this by consciously pushing things into the slow system and thinking through things (or re-thinking) rather than jumping to conclusions.

It's also a reminder than most things aren't binary: they exist on a spectrum. Our brains put them into categories, but the categories have (very) fuzzy edges.

For teaching and learning, it's a good reminder that different is better than same. Keep mixing things up to keep people's brains active and engaged.
