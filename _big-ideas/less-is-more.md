title: Less is more
---

### What is it?

This covers a few things.

- Doing less, maybe nothing
- Doing tiny experiments to test ideas
- Being happy with less

### Why is it important?

Doing less means more time on each thing, which means you can do each thing better. It lets you work at a more sustainable pace.

When you're not sure about something, the best way to gather data is to do something. To test the idea, rather than get caught in endless loops of thinking.

Satisfying your desires isn't a good path to happiness. Having fewer desires and being happy with what you already have is.
