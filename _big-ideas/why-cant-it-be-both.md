### What is it?

The idea that things and people are sometimes contradictory: they can be two seemingly different things at the same time.

It helps to see things and people as they are: complex. Being able to hold two (seemingly) contradictory ideas in your heads at once is a sign of emotional intelligence and maturity. It's also really difficult!
