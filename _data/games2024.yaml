  tinyreview: "So, so, charming! Fun, short, little puzzle platformer, with a cute 2D/3D gimmick. Got a little bored at the end, feeling like I'd seen all it's tricks. But the charm is so very charming."

  tinyreview: "Ha! A surreal, funny, oh-so-English, point-and-click-ish, platform-ish, little bundle of joy. So creative and weird and joyful. A great reminder that games can be fun for the fun of it."

  tinyreview: "So difficult, so beautiful, so amazing. It does an excellent job of resetting. It felt so similar to playing Elden Ring, or Dark Souls 3, for the first time. In particular, the first few hours felt brutal and vertical, but then you start to get the hang out it, you level up a bit, and things go from feeling insurmountable to just very difficult. Stunning world and level art and design."

  tinyreview: "Tears of the Kingdom is maybe a better video game, but BotW is a better experience. Where TotK is busy, BotW is empty. Where TotK is noisy, BotW is quiet. Where TotK is moving, BotW is still. Where TotK is fast, BotW is slow. Where TotK is dense, BotW is sparse. Where TotK is excessive, BotW is restrained. I think I prefer BotW to TotK."
