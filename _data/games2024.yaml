  tinyreview: "Tears of the Kingdom is maybe a better video game, but BotW is a better experience. Where TotK is busy, BotW is empty. Where TotK is noisy, BotW is quiet. Where TotK is moving, BotW is still. Where TotK is fast, BotW is slow. Where TotK is dense, BotW is sparse. Where TotK is excessive, BotW is restrained. I think I prefer BotW to TotK."
