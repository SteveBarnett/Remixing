  tinyreview: "Hot damn! High speed, high adrenaline, mech attack action, with a Fromsoftware twist. Tough as nails, but oh so rewarding when you crack it. Generally a bit bleak and desolate, though."

  tinyreview: "Gorgeous rugged mythical Japanese landscapes. Brutal but rewarding and musical, rhythmical, fast-paced, sword-fighting. The rewards come the player becoming better, not the character."

  tinyreview: "Intensely demanding and incredibly stylish kung-fu action. An audio-visual feast and a finely tuned rhythm action (fighting) game. Asks a lot of the player, but the sense of satisfaction goes deep."

  tinyreview: "Absolutely bonkers turn-based JRPG with lovable, flawed, realistic, ridiculous, heroes. An absolute blast to play, but pretty long to finish."
