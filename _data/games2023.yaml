  tinyreview: "Intensely demanding and incredibly stylish kung-fu action. An audio-visual feast and a finely tuned rhythm action (fighting) game. Asks a lot of the player, but the sense of satisfaction goes deep."

  tinyreview: "Absolutely bonkers turn-based JRPG with lovable, flawed, realistic, ridiculous, heroes. An absolute blast to play, but pretty long to finish."
