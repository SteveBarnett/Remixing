- Quiet a quiet month.
- Cormac McCarthy's The Passenger was great, but sometimes difficult to read.
- Wrote lots of notes under [human](/thinking/topics/human/) and [Buddhism](/thinking/topics/buddhism/) categories.
- Made a short note-to-self: Change your tone from critic to coach.
- Hadn't started Collections or Longer form Thinking pages yet.
- Sketching people and riffs on the Taijitu.
