{% include header.html title="Big Ideas" %}

These are a handful of ideas that made me stop and think. They changed how I think about things and how I try to be in the world. They come from a wide range of sources that I'll list at some point. I'm not sure yet what I'm doing with this list, but writing it down felt like a good first step.

    <ul>
      {% for big-idea in site.big-ideas %}<li><a href="#{{ big-idea.title | replace: " ", "-" | remove: "," | downcase }}">{{ big-idea.title }}</a></li>{% endfor %}
    </ul>

    {% for big-idea in site.big-ideas %}
      
    <h2 id="{{ big-idea.title | replace: " ", "-" | remove: "," | downcase }}">{{ big-idea.title }}</h2>

    {{ big-idea.content }}
  
    {% endfor %}
