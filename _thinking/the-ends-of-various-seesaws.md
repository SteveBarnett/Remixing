What, When, Where, Who, Why, How can I slide more towards the other ends?

Slide some of Moving-Away-Distraction-Avoid? Instead of Still, just **Moving more slowly**. Instead of Distraction, **a little more Attention**. When I notice Tightness, bring a little **Looseness** to it. When I notice I'm being Closed, bring a little more **Openness** to it.

[LSD](/thinking/lsd/) seems like a good fit: Listen, Slow your tempo, Doubt.

- **Listen**
    - Notice more precisely, without judgement. In listening, thereâ€™s already some acceptance
    - Look / listen for: 
        - the centre (your true nature, your self at zero distance)
        - the edges (the boundarylessness of everything, distinction but not division)
        - the changes (the ever-moving flow of Reality).
- **Slow your tempo**
    - Listen more carefully, more closely.
- **Doubt**
    - Go wider, open up, question.
