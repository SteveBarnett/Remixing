- TODO: overlaps, boundaries, flywheel, piggyblocking, habits.
- TODO: what feelings, state(s), do these bring about?

There a couple of different ways of looking at it. The boundaries can be a bit blurry, and overlap. There's distinction, but not division, between the categories.

## Spectrums

- For fun (self-fulfilling) / For an outcome
- On my own / with others
- For myself / for others
- Do already / don't do already
- Easy / Difficult
- Regular / irregular
- Calming / invigorating
- Physical / mental
- Home / Out
- Focused / Diffuse
- In the spotlight / In the background

## [Ten Fields of Zen Practice](/thinking/zen/10-fields-of-zen-practice/#ten-fields-of-zen-practice)

- Not aiming to attain anything.
- “Practising to get better” and “practising because it’s how we want to be” balance each other excesses out.
- Progress on the path is not straightforward, linear.

The fields:

- Bodhicitta – Nurturing the Mind that Seeks the Way
- Zazen – The Sacred Act of Just Being
- Mindfulness – Silent Illumination Every Moment
- Dharma Study – Wrestling with the Teachings
- Precepts – Studying the Self and Transcending Self-Attachment
- Karma Work – Taking Care of Our Lives
- Relationships – Opening the Heart and Exploring Non-Separation
