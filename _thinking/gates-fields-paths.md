The vibes:

- Not aiming to attain anything.
- “Practising to get better” and “practising because it’s how we want to be” balance each other excesses out.
- Progress on the path is not straightforward, linear.
- Practice is like walking in a fine mist. After some time you find you are thoroughly wet.
- Direct experience of Reality, in particular nonduality.
- The sacredness of ordinary, everyday, acts.
- Engaging and unifying body and mind in practice, art, health.

- meditating
- cooking
