    - Validate their feelings without agreeing. Gently draw attention to their good traits.
    - Instead of trying to refute their negative thoughts, try validating their feelings without agreeing. Then gently draw their attention to their strengths and positive traits.

- Listen to them. Do not try to fix their problems, give unsolicited advice, or judge their feelings.
- Offer to help with tasks. E.g. walk the dog.
- Stay in touch. Let your loved one know that you’re thinking of them and would love to spend time together, if and when they feel up for it.
- Do positive activities together. Nature, making art.
- Bring over your pet.
- Let them know you care and are there to listen.
- Accept them as they are, without judging them.
- Gently encourage them to help themselves
- Stay in touch with them by messaging, texting, phoning or meeting for coffee. People who are depressed can become isolated and may find it difficult to leave their home.
- Try to be patient. They might not want to share things right away.
- Take care of yourself.
- They need your support more than your advice.
- Try to understand the situation from their point of view.
- Sticking around shows you care
- Ask how you can help
- Be an active listener 
- Find outdoor activities to do together 
- Offer to help with tasks
- ‘I’m here for you’
- Aim to encourage instead of giving advice
- Instead of trying to refute their negative thoughts, try validating their feelings without agreeing. Then gently draw their attention to their strengths and positive traits.
- Use these four steps and have a conversation that could change a life: Ask R U OK?; Listen; Encourage action; Check in
