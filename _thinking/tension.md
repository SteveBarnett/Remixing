Creative tension. High energy. Manifesting, taking the form of, restlessness. The crackle of energy in the gap between is and could or should.

## Raw notes

### Opposites and energy

- Settle into an energetic balance, “between” two poles / opposites.
- We habitually resist unpleasant experiences, which sustains and prolongs them.
- By focusing attention on a concept we create its opposite.
- The whole truth is the reconciliation and holding together of opposites.
- Opposites complete, test, determine, harmonise, give sequence to one another.
- Polarities create friction when they feel like opposites, contradictions.
- In between any two opposites lies emptiness, creative potential.
- Polarities create friction when they feel like opposites, contradictions.
- Notice, harmonise, and integrate patterns in polarities.
- All things change and flow, continuously becoming their opposite.
- The taut string of a bow gives rise to the power to fire an arrow.
- Asymmetry is more important than symmetry. It can contain symmetry.
- Why can’t it be both? Some things that look like a dichotomy, aren't.
- Form is employed to make things clever. Emptiness is employed to make things useful.
- Opposites co-exist, making something new and taut and harmonious.
- Complementary forces, interacting to form a dynamic system.

### Motion

- Recognise your self as overlapping, malleable, stories.
- Life is defined by growth and transformation, aliveness.
- We learn, grow, in hierarchical spirals.
- Resistance to the flow brings beauty, complexity.
- Nothing really forms long enough to be an impermanent thing.

### Energy

- We need to balance calmness/energy and stillness/brightness.
- By accepting self-doubt, rather than trying to eliminate or repress it, we lessen its energy and interference.
- Sameness smooths and calms, difference injects energy and movement.
- Sameness brings peace, difference brings energy.
- Resolving a conflict creatively is an exercise in growth, but/and we can develop a taste for working with this disruptive energy.
- Koans are a good way to ... harness the energy of inquisitiveness and activate intuition.
- Free up energy by letting go perceptual and cognitive boundaries produced by fixation on limited views.
