**High energy** manifesting, taking the form of, [restlessness](/thinking/restless-word-salad/). The crackle of energy in the gap between "is" and "could" (or "should"). Like synapses ‚ö°Ô∏è or the charge between magnetic poles üß≠.

## Gathered notes

- **The tension between poles creates energy.**
    - [That can be helpful or a hindrance](/thinking/the-three-uhds/#flavours-of-tension).
- **The space between poles is empty.**
    - [Empty as in possibility, like a cup before it‚Äôs filled](/thinking/empty/).
- **Notice what poles you're using.**
    - Consider the risks and rewards of focusing too much on one pole.

### What it is

- Polarities create friction when they feel like opposites, contradictions.
    - Really it's more like "Why can‚Äôt it be both?"
- Poles form pairs of complementary forces. Their interaction makes motion, an energetic balance between the two.
    - The tension, tautness, between them is what creates the energy.
    - Sameness brings stillness, difference brings movement.
- Between the poles is [emptiness](/thinking/empty/), creative potential, possibility.

### What to do

- Notice the polarities.
- Notice the risks/rewards of neglecting/focusing on each pole.
- Harmonise and integrate and balance the polarities.
    - But watch more the wider, more important, pole.
    - For example: asymmetry is more important than symmetry because it can contain symmetry.
- Develop a taste for working with this disruptive energy.

## Raw notes

### Opposites and energy

- Settle into an energetic balance, ‚Äúbetween‚Äù two poles / opposites.
- We habitually resist unpleasant experiences, which sustains and prolongs them.
- By focusing attention on a concept we create its opposite.
- The whole truth is the reconciliation and holding together of opposites.
- Opposites complete, test, determine, harmonise, give sequence to one another.
- Polarities create friction when they feel like opposites, contradictions.
- In between any two opposites lies emptiness, creative potential.
- Polarities create friction when they feel like opposites, contradictions.
- Notice, harmonise, and integrate patterns in polarities.
- All things change and flow, continuously becoming their opposite.
- The taut string of a bow gives rise to the power to fire an arrow.
- Asymmetry is more important than symmetry. It can contain symmetry.
- Why can‚Äôt it be both? Some things that look like a dichotomy, aren't.
- Form is employed to make things clever. Emptiness is employed to make things useful.
- Opposites co-exist, making something new and taut and harmonious.
- Complementary forces, interacting to form a dynamic system.

### Motion

- Recognise your self as overlapping, malleable, stories.
- Life is defined by growth and transformation, aliveness.
- We learn, grow, in hierarchical spirals.
- Resistance to the flow brings beauty, complexity.
- Nothing really forms long enough to be an impermanent thing.

### Energy

- We need to balance calmness/energy and stillness/brightness.
- By accepting self-doubt, rather than trying to eliminate or repress it, we lessen its energy and interference.
- Sameness smooths and calms, difference injects energy and movement.
- Sameness brings peace, difference brings energy.
- Resolving a conflict creatively is an exercise in growth, but/and we can develop a taste for working with this disruptive energy.
- Koans are a good way to ... harness the energy of inquisitiveness and activate intuition.
- Free up energy by letting go perceptual and cognitive boundaries produced by fixation on limited views.
