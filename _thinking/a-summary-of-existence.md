## Gathered notes

- Life simply happens on its own.
- Life expresses itself clearly and simply.
    - We can notice this when we sit quietly, resting, making no effort.
- Nondual descriptions of Reality, of the Absolute and the Relative, are simple descriptions of ordinary, everyday, life. 
    - But they can only point to different portions of the happening, not the happening itself.
    - The happening is felt, not described.
    - The more we try and describe and explain it, the less clear it becomes.
- There is only the inexplicable, formless dance presenting itself.
- When our direction isn't clear, we can sit, be quiet, and rest. We wait for our inuition to push forward and reveal the next step.
- We are something the whole universe is doing in the same way that a wave is something the whole ocean is doing.
- There is an inherent urge in the universe for all apparent things to reach their full, and unique, potential.

## Raw notes


- If we sit quietly, making no effort, life expresses itself clearly; it simply happens on its own.
- All things, all actions, all thoughts, words, and deeds, are the passing appearances and expressions of a great unformed, indefinable event.
- Phrases such as “there is no self,” or “there is only God,” are very simple descriptions of your ordinary, everyday life.
- All forms that appear to exist are moving on to some other appearance. What “is” has no form.
- Without forms and labels what is there to question?
- There is only an inexplicable, formless dance presenting itself.
- the labels don’t tell us what this happening is. They simply point to different portions of the event.
- No one is making this happen. If we sit here, resting, making no effort at all, this happening of the moment still happens.
- Why look for truth in fantasies of name and form, when it is so easily felt in the flowing of this moment?
- Like a flower, like a sunrise, like the galaxy itself, we are the wonder of creation, the warm, intimate, unfolding of this moment,
- We are an unexplainable functioning.
- If we are without direction, we can withdraw to solitude and our deepest urges and intuitions will push themselves forward to reveal our next step.
- Everything is simply one movement. What we think of as outside of us and inside of us is one movement.
- You are something the whole universe is doing in the same way that a wave is something the whole ocean
is doing.
- everything is happening on its own, without us “doing” it.
- the word universe literally means undivided turning (undivided movement).
- Our separation from each other is an optical illusion.
- There is an inherent urge in the universe for all apparent things to reach their full, and unique, potential.
- In any moment, just be the unexplainable happening that you are and do what you feel you need to do.
- If your direction isn’t clear, sit down somewhere quiet and simply rest.
- ironically, the more one focuses on ideas and explanations, the less clear it becomes that everything is unexplainable movement, moving on its own.
- It only becomes clear when we sit down, or lie down, making no effort to do anything, and simply feel this happening, happening.
- Clarity abandons understanding and rests as this unexplainable occurrence.
- Clarity abandons understanding and rests in spontaneity.
