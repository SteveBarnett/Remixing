I've used ["word salad" a few times](/thinking/archive/?s=salad) as a linguistic shorthand. This is about how words, concepts, are simple and static pointers to a reality that's complex and in constant flux. When we use words as pointers and have a bunch of pointers (a word salad) we can get a more clear, more complete, picture.

Sort of something like:

- multiple signposts along a journey
- a bento box – many pieces making up the whole
- the [Genderbread Person](https://www.samkillermann.com/work/genderbread-person/) (an adorable, digestible, model for understanding the complexity of gender) – multiple aspects and angle
- an intersectional lens being the most truthy version of how to understand a thing – combinations and overlaps creating something new and different
