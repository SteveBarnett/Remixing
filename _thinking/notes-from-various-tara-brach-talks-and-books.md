- Our qualities and behaviours are the product of many causes and conditions. 
- When these don't match with what our culture, our parents, our friends tell us are acceptable, loveable, worthy, we run away from that discomfort.
- But pushing away creates a barrier, creates separation. The path is to accept life as it is, more and more.
- The A (Allow, or Accept) in RAIN creates a pause. It gives us a little space to respond more wisely, more compassionately.

Matching this up a bit with [the three uhds](/thinking/the-three-uhds/):

- **Let go of the shoulds.**
    - Our culture, our parents, our friends, and more, determine which qualities and behaviours are deemed good, loveable, worthy.
- **Let go of the coulds.**
    - Our qualities and behaviours are the product of many causes and conditions. 
- **Rest in the good(s).**
    - Notice that as we tend to focus on what's wrong with us, what's missing.
    - Meet your edge and soften.

## Gathered notes

- Our qualities and behaviours are the product of many causes and conditions.
    - (See also: [the could in the three uhds](/thinking/the-three-uhds/#coulds))
- Our culture, our parents, our friends, and more, determine which qualities and behaviours are deemed good, loveable, worthy.
    - This conditioning goes deep.
    - As humans, we tend to focus on what's wrong with us, what's missing.
- We tend to run away from discomfort.
- The path is to accept life as it is, more and more.
    - Pushing away creates a barrier, creates separation.
- The A (Allow, or Accept) in RAIN creates a pause.
    - It gives us just a little space to respond more effectively, sustainably, from love, wholeness, and peace.
- Meet your edge and soften.
    - Mindfully recognise and bring compassion to the parts of our being we've ignored, condemned, pushed away.


## Raw notes

- **Culture, parents, the Western creation myth often communicate that be love, approved, worthy, we need to look and act a certain way.**
- We sense we're intrinsically flawed, and we're worried others will find out.
- I am bad, I am falling short, I am wrong.
- Embrace life in all its messy, broken, realness.
- **Mindfully recognise and bring compassion to the parts of our being we've ignored, condemned, pushed away.**
- What wants attention or acceptance right now?
- All being have a negativity bias for survival, but humans identify with it.
- We tend to get down on ourselves about our conditioning, but it's not personal.
- **Does judging yourself work? Check! (Spoilers: no)**
- Have an inner coach instead of an inner critic.
- **The A in RAIN creates a pause.**
- Try expressing the I of RAIN somatically: with your face, with your posture.
- We're addicted to running away from discomfort.
- Blocks to contentment: focusing on what's wrong; focusing on what's missing.
- Acceptance lets us respond more effectively, sustainably, from love, wholeness, and peace.
- Not "bad self", but patterns, conditioned identification.
- You are not your thoughts. Where do they come from? Where do they go?
- Be happy for no reason. Rather than only when they go your way.
- See things as they are. Without judgement. Without labelling them good or bad.
- Accept, let go. Pushing away creates a barrier.
- Trying to hide feelings deepens the separation.
- Accept life, just as it is.
- Hold things with compassion. This belongs.
- Meet your edge and soften.
- Our Buddha nature is always there. But sometimes it's concealed.
