### What is it?

- Life is connected. Reality is a single, indivisible, thing. We use concepts to put imaginary fences around aggregates of things. Subject and object are distinct but not separate.
- People are connected. There's almost nothing we do that we truly do alone, or that truly effects no-one but ourselves. 
- Tasks are connected. Most things we do aren't just for the sake of that single outcome. They're part of a bigger project or goal.

### Why is it important?

Seeing the links between things lets us zoom out to see the big picture and zoom in to see the details.

It can be a helpful, motivating, reminder to see why you're working on a particular thing, what the larger purpose of it is. We can set things up so that each task connects to a project, which connects to a personal value. This lets us remember and realise why we're doing a given thing.

It can help to see progress towards a project goal by seeing the individual tasks tick by.
