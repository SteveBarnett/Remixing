- Movement between [layers](/thinking/layers/), due to differences either side of a boundary. Tipping over a brink, a threshold.
- Life is defined by growth and transformation. A change between states require energy and action.
- Working with what you habitually reject is one of the best ways to facilitate growth and transformation.

## [Osmosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis)

Movement from high potential & low concentration to low potential & high concentration, through a selectively-permeable membrane. 

> Osmosis is the spontaneous net movement or diffusion of solvent molecules through a selectively-permeable membrane from a region of high water potential (region of lower solute concentration) to a region of low water potential (region of higher solute concentration), in the direction that tends to equalize the solute concentrations on the two sides.<br>
<br>
Biological membranes are semipermeable.<br>
<br>
Permeability depends on solubility, charge, or chemistry, as well as solute size.<br>
<br>
Osmotic pressure is the minimum pressure which needs to be applied to a solution to prevent the inward flow of its pure solvent across a semipermeable membrane.<br>
<br>
Osmotic gradient is the difference in concentration between two solutions on either side of a semipermeable membrane, and is used to tell the difference in percentages of the concentration of a specific particle dissolved in a solution. 

## [Semipermeable membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipermeable_membrane)

> Semipermeable membrane is a type of synthetic or biologic, polymeric membrane that allows certain molecules or ions to pass through it by osmosis. The rate of passage depends on the pressure, concentration, and temperature of the molecules or solutes on either side, as well as the permeability of the membrane to each solute. Depending on the membrane and the solute, permeability may depend on solute size, solubility, properties, or chemistry. How the membrane is constructed to be selective in its permeability will determine the rate and the permeability. Many natural and synthetic materials which are rather thick are also semipermeable. One example of this is the thin film on the inside of an egg.
