- Let go of the belief that "this isn't it."
- Recognise what's arising in consciousness without trying to control or change or fix it.
    - Just leave everything where it is.

- We can be happy now.
    - We don't have to wait until (the imaginary and impossible future when) we've solved all our problems.
- Practice is not having a problem with having problems.
    - Don't cling to your own comfort and problems become no problem.
