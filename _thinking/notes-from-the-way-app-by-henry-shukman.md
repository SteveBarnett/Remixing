- Deep and transformative changes can happen when we sit and find stillness, even just for a little while, each day.
- Over time, as we meditate, a deeper knowledge comes of our own experience, our own life.
- Four zones of practice essential for a deep and fulfilling meditative journey:
    - Mindfulness: to be truly aware of present moment experience, and succumb less frequently to entrapment by thoughts and reactivity
    - Support: to recognise that we are not lone agents, but in fact are part of a rich network of causes and effects that support us
    - Flow: to rest in deep states of absorption and ease, where the sense of self goes quiet
    - Awakening: to pierce the illusions we carry around with us and see into the true nature of ourselves and our non-dual relationship to the world. 
- Seven common hindrances
    - Restlessness
    - Reluctance
    - Worry
    - Dullness
    - Desire-craving
    - Aversion-resistance
    - Doubt
- A single awareness from which flows an unlimited and deep wellbeing.
- Come home to a place of ease, quiet and rest, right in the centre of everyday experience.
- Gently wear down the idea that we're separate, independent, entities in the world by seeing how all of what we are depends thoroughly on things outside of us.
    - The self is just a story we tell ourselves. Once we see that, our attachment to the story can soften.
