- Deep and transformative changes can happen when we sit and find stillness, even just for a little while, each day.
- Over time, as we meditate, a deeper knowledge comes of our own experience, our own life.
- Four zones of practice essential for a deep and fulfilling meditative journey:
    - Mindfulness: to be truly aware of present moment experience, and succumb less frequently to entrapment by thoughts and reactivity
    - Support: to recognise that we are not lone agents, but in fact are part of a rich network of causes and effects that support us
    - Flow: to rest in deep states of absorption and ease, where the sense of self goes quiet
    - Awakening: to pierce the illusions we carry around with us and see into the true nature of ourselves and our non-dual relationship to the world. 
- Seven common hindrances
    - Restlessness
    - Reluctance
    - Worry
    - Dullness
    - Desire-craving
    - Aversion-resistance
    - Doubt
- A single awareness from which flows an unlimited and deep wellbeing.
- Come home to a place of ease, quiet and rest, right in the centre of everyday experience.
- Gently wear down the idea that we're separate, independent, entities in the world by seeing how all of what we are depends thoroughly on things outside of us.
    - The self is just a story we tell ourselves. Once we see that, our attachment to the story can soften.
- No effort.
    - No need to change anything.
    - No need to make anything happen.
    - No looking forward.
    - Notice that we don't actually need to do anything to receive sounds, sensations, thoughts, feelings. They arise in our awareness by themselves
    - The whole world is arising just as it does, without effort – everything unfolding by itself, just as it does.
- It’s possible to reduce, or even to give up – if just for a little while – the endless quest to arrange our lives. And to find a very different kind of fulfillment, one that is intrinsic to the bare fact of being alive, and is always already here. 
- In awakening, we can recognise that we are not actually the contents of awareness. Rather, we are in fact the broader context that awareness is. We are simply awareness itself. An open, boundless, center-less space in which all things arise.
- In Buddhism they talk about two forms of knowing: ‘understanding’ and ‘recognizing’. We can cognitively understand something, but it’s a different thing to recognize it as true, through our own personal experience. 
- The more we allow ourselves to release our need to do and to strive, the more we may come to feel like there really is a deeper part of us that is simply an ever-present state of restfulness.
- We can start to discover a deep contentment in letting go of the need to move.
- Learning not just to have a still body, but to be comfortable in it, is a tried and tested way for helping the mind slow down and become more still.
- There is a place we can find in our own first-person field of experience that is always still.
- Awareness itself is also somehow 'still'. It can't move. It doesn't change. Movement can only occur in relation to something else.
- Yaoshan: 'take the backward step that shines the lamp inward.'
    - Something like: 'relax, don't strive, release back into a light of awareness that is already present.'
    - The advice of taking a 'backward step' seems to suggest that it won't help to be 'striving forward'.
- It’s not an answer on the same level that any question about it is asked. It’s not on the same level as all other questions and answers we have known.
- By seeing the operation of preference within us, we can learn to identify with it less, be less caught by it in daily life.
- Preferences act as a strong reinforcing mechanism for the idea of the self. When we really observe desire or aversion arising as phenomena in and of themselves, we start to see that they can arise without the need for any self to be implicated in them.
- The gateless gate. The wisdom of these great meditation traditions is that to recognize this shift is not so easy to do in a deliberate way. It is often better done more by a process of releasing, of letting go, of letting things drop, as we sit. 
- ... Mindfulness, Support and Flow. There are so many treasures that meditation helps us with in these zones, without needing to worry about the question of awakening. We can consider awakening a compass heading that guides the vessel of our practice, but meanwhile the voyage itself is full of adventure and learning all along the way.
- I had been sitting with a koan for months, seemingly getting nowhere. But in fact, I was slowly learning to be patient with the practice, and stop minding whether anything 'happened' or not. And that was already a kind of progress.
- koans are a 'language' that will only make sense when we let go of our ordinary construal of reality, and come to know the experience of any ordinary moment in a very different light – one not filtered and shaped by the assumptions and preconceptions of our everyday sense of self. For sure, they are not the only way to catch a glimpse of the non-dual. But the fact that they are mysterious and elliptical, and work indirectly, through poetic phrasing, seems to me to greatly recommend them. After all, we are grappling with the inexpressible here. It seems only right that it be conveyed by the nudges, winks and asides of the koan way.
- **Meditation will not stop thoughts and feelings from arising, any more than you can stop the sound of a car horn beeping nearby from reaching your ears.**
- With a koan, said Da-hui: eventually the mind may be so deep in the conundrums and paradoxes of a koan that eventually it just can’t move any more. It gets stuck. Exhausted by its own efforts, silenced by its own questioning, it may finally start to doubt its own version of reality, and relax its grip. It’s then, caught in its own entrapment, stuck in its tracks, that it can become still. Suddenly it’s truly silenced. And an entirely different view of reality breaks forth
- The practice of meditation encourages resting in an awareness that holds all our thoughts and feelings – an awareness that is actually the space in which both cognitive and affective experience arises. But more than that, this awareness is the fundamental condition for all experience, of any kind at all. 
- A reminder on these four primary faces of flow states:
    - Effortlessness: That release where everything suddenly seems to be happening by itself.
    - Fulfillment: A sense of intrinsic fulfillment, where nothing at all is lacking.
    - Timelessness: When the present moment is the only time there is, and clock time vanishes.
    - Selflessness: A beautiful shift where self-consciousness goes quiet.
