## Session notes

Note to self: I'd like the focus of this session to be about "meditating off the cushion." How can we be better people to the people around us?

Something I've found really powerful is the practice of "Begin again."

My experience with this practice is that the bad feelings (like judgement or frustration or anger) sublimates: it goes from feeling solid to feeling like a gas. Which then dissipates as in a strong breeze.

The practice is: as soon as you notice, begin again. Let go of the past, of whatever has come before. Drop whatever story you've been telling yourself. Forgive yourself any mistakes and failures up until now. And you act like you would on your best day.

Something that maybe makes it stand out for me is that it's clear that this is not just about meditation. It's about life, about how we are with ourselves, with other people. (And one of the secrets is that they're not separate things)

If you're meditating and you notice you were lost in thought. Just begin again.
If you're talking to someone  and you notice that you weren't being as kind or patient as you would like. Just begin again.
Just drop the past, the story. Treat this next moment as if it's brand new, totally fresh.
Another way of putting it: “Treat the next thing as the first thing.”

Something to note is that it's very rarely a "one and done."
Begin again, in this moment. And then begin again again, a few moments from now.
That's the practice. Beginning again, again.
