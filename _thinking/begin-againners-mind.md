## Raw notes

- "Begin again" can be powerful.
- Stops a mistake (or many mistakes!) snowballing into a failure.
- Treat the next thing as the first thing.
- Seize the (rest of the) day.
- Forgive yourself, completely and immediately.
- Begin again, in each moment.
- Clear noticing of the present moment.
- Without judgement, without disappointment, without contraction.
- It's always possible to recover this freedom.
- Break the spell at any point.
- Notice frustration, judgement, as appearances in consciousness.
- They're just as good as objects of meditation.
- Ethical force too. The only way to truly forgive is to restart the clock in the present.
- We get hundreds of opportunities a day to practice it.
- The moment you notice, begin again, fully commit, by relinquishing the past.
- Stop telling yourself a story about the past. Fully commit to the present.
- We must always begin again. Nothing lasts.
- The present moment is our only opportunity to connect with life.
- It's how we surmount every embarrassment, indignity, disappointment.
- Live the next moment as though it's new, because it is.
- Just begin again.
- There's no reason to hesitate to begin again.
- Tomorrow never comes. Begin again now.
- Freedom is not elsewhere, or later. It's here, now.
- Don't hold yourself hostage, contingent on unmet demands.
- Whatever's been done or left undone, just begin again.
- Everything is fit object of mindfulness. Including fidgeting.
- There's no boundary between meditation and life.
- Aspire towards living without regret.
- Use regret to strengthen your commitment to being free.
- You're utterly free to begin again in this moment.
- Drop your reactivity entirely. Become weightless.
- Rest as consciousness, in this moment. And again, mere moments from now.
- Completely surrender. Give up the war.
- The practice is to recognise that experience is only consciousness and its contents.
- Everyone is merely striving to be happy.
- Feel compassion for this whole catastrophe.
- Let regret energise you, get your priorities straight.
- Be grateful to see your missteps. To have a chance to start again.
- Commit to enjoying the process.
- Forgive yourself every failure.
- Judgement is just another thought.
