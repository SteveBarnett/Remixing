There are lots of ways we get in the way of our own happiness.

- **We make specific requirements for our happiness**. If the conditions aren't met, we can't be happy.
- **We overlook opportunities for happiness** that are already here. This is made worse by the requirements thing.
- **We don't believe we can have happiness and sadness at the same time.** It seems like a paradox.
