## Raw notes

### I. The Myth of Freedom

- **We must work with our fears, frustrations, disappointments and irritations, the painful aspects of life.**
- We must see the truth of suffering, the reality of dissatisfaction.
- Doing nothing is very difficult.
- The basic practice is to be present, right there. The goal is also the technique.
- Meditation practice brings our neuroses to the surface rather than hiding them at the bottom of our minds.
- **The mundanity of our lives is the food for our practice.**
- Practice is a constant unmasking, peeling off of layers.
- Pain increases as the questions become more solid and the answers become more elusive.
- It is a succession of confusions that create the ego.
- There are two stages to understanding egolessness.
    - Perceiving that an ego does not exist as a solid, permanent, stable, entity.
    - Understanding that the notion of relativity needs a watcher to perceive it, which produces the watcher and the watched.

### II. Styles of Imprisonment

- We use our projections as credentials to prove our existence.
- We cling to our habitual patterns because confusion provides a familiar ground to sink into.
- A heroic approach is based on fascination with what we lack. Continual comparing generates a never-ending procession of desires.
- **You cannot really eliminate pain through aggression. The more you kill, the more you strengthen the killer.**

### III. Sitting Meditation

- We must be willing to be completely ordinary people. Accepting ourselves as we are, without trying to become greater, purer, more spiritual, more insightful. 
    - **If we try to get rid of our imperfections, they become obstacles to our "self-improvement."**
    - **If we accept our imperfections, they become part of the path.**
- Paying attention to thoughts, categorising them, trying to quiet them down, all feeds them.
- If we do not interfere with our restlessness, it becomes part of the space.

### IV. Working with the Emotions

- **True spirituality is not a battle; it is the ultimate practice of non-violence.**
- The "lion's roar" is the fearless proclamation that any state of mind, any emotion, is a workable situation, a practice reminder.
- **There's nothing to take over if you are not putting up any resistance.**

### V. Meditation in Action

- Become one with awareness, one with open space.
- Open up your territory rather than march into someone else's.
- Learn not to make a nuisance of yourself, open yourself to other people.
- "Right" in the Eightfold Path as in "what is", "complete".

## VI. The Open Way

- A teacher or fellow traveller can show us where we are on the map, but we have to make the journey ourselves.
- When we try to disentangle ourselves, the first thing we experience is entanglement.
- **There is no hope of attaining enlightenment because it is nobody's project.**
- The path is like a busy, broad, highway, with roadblocks, accidents, construction.
- **The impulse to tell people how things ought to be is an expression of our insecurity.**
- **Don't take sides against traditions or our state of mind, but take delight in them and work with them.**
    - Firmly root in your society's traditions, but don't feel obligated to follow them. Understand the wisdom and the dogma in it.

### VII. Devotion

- Teachers can act as a mirror, which we find irritating or discomforting.
- **The events of your life act as a spokesperson constantly and you cannot get away from this guru.**

### VIII. Tantra

- Your setbacks and suffering are part of the creative process of the path.
- Develop an attitude of richness and generosity.
