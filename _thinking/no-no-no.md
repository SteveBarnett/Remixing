## No escape

- Note, label, get back to the present
    - acknowledge, without judgement
- Life's work is to wake up, find your middle way
- A good laugh is the best way to see the truth, to see your mistakes
- Trying to avoid or escape suffering just makes matters worse.
- Suffering is part of this aliveness. Efforts to avoid suffering or escape from suffering are a denial of this aliveness.
- Work with what you find. Don't try and escape the chaos of the world.
- Every thing causes some problems. The thought that life shouldn’t be a struggle is painful, so we try to escape it.
- The thought that life shouldn't be a struggle is painful, so we try to escape it.
- Be here with whatever arises, without picking and choosing, without trying to escape
- being at the end of our rope in a state of burnout can also be a gift, because it highlights the fact that we’ve run out of escape routes.
- In a sense, opinions provide a way to escape. They create a kind of slothfulness and obscure one's clarity of vision.
- Freedom lies in perceiving that all things arise from causes and conditions, not trying to escape it
- You cannot escape from this moment. Where would you go? You must live with whatever you see, feel, and think.
- When the effort to escape from what is—from what actually exists, regardless of how one feels about it—comes to an end, and the fantasy of attaining something “better” ceases, one is awake. There is nothing hidden or esoteric about this.
- When various thoughts arise in your mind, do not become caught up by them or struggle with them; neither pursue nor try to escape from them. Just leave thoughts alone, allowing them to come up and go away freely.
- Things become very clear when there is nowhere to escape.
- What we discipline is not our “badness” or our “wrongness.” What we discipline is any form of potential escape from reality.
- We need strong motivation to stick with it because the desire to escape is so compelling
- There's no escape from our experience, nowhere to go
- allowing us to see clearly what our escape routes are and enabling us not to take them
- whenever we have the urge to act out our desires or aggression, or escape in any form—we refrain
- We come to see pain as something that can transform us, not as something to escape at any cost.
- When you can smile at fear, there’s a shift: what you usually try to escape from becomes a vehicle for awakening you to your fundamental, primordial goodness, for awakening you to clear-mindedness, to a caring that holds nothing back.
- at bottom, those opinions are merely our efforts to escape the underlying uneasiness of being human, the uneasiness of feeling like we can’t get ground under our feet
- No escape from the fundamental anxiety of a being a human, having visceral feeling that things aren’t right
- We find all sorts of ways to escape from dealing with the present

## No hope

- Once we abandon the hope that there's a rational answer it takes us toward (perfect and all-encompassing) reality.
- A koan's significance becomes clear once we finally abandon the hope that something can be achieved.
- There's nothing that needs to be developed; all the student must do is simply renounce both the hope that there is something that can be achieved through the practice as well as the conceit that they will achieve that result.
- In living, as in dying, when we hold hope apart from expectation, independent of attachment to outcome, we develop a wise connection with reality.
- Master an empty, silent mind in accord with suchness, without any sense of gaining anything, without any sense of winning or losing, without any sense of hope or expectation, without excitement or oblivion.
- In the beginner’s mind there is no thought of attainment. No hope for a future outcome.

## No goal 

- Long-term peace doesn't come from achieving the next goal. There's always another goal.
- The path is goal. Living a good enough, ordinary, life.
- Take the path as the goal. Have no attachment to the outcome.
- Just do what needs to be done. Free of goals or outcomes.
- Life is more like a dance or a song than a grueling, goal-oriented task.
- We have to be open to the idea that we may not achieve anything at all that corresponds to our preconceived idea of what the goal of practice might be.
- Self-fulfilling and playful, not goal-based or outcome-based
- No goal, no outcome, no purpose, no winning or losing
- Bring open attention, simply notice what is. Without any agenda or goal. Without wanting to change or control or correct.
- Zazen is not the means of attaining any goal other than Zazen.
- When we concentrate fully on our work, there is no goal.
- Running after our goals endlessly, our own footing becomes less and less secure moment by moment.
- The spontaneity associated with Zen is simply a groundless samadhi of self-fulfilling activity. Free of reasons, grounds, goals, or outcomes. Play is the best example.
- On the Soto Zen path, Realization, Quiet Mind, and Samadhi are not goals but descriptions of what happens as you let go.
