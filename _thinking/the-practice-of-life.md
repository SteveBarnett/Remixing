Notes from [The Practice of Life by Charlotte Joko Beck of the Waking Up app](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/pack/PK7AFA7?code=SC541514D&share_id=E191F0EE&source=content%20share).

Some things that feel fresh for me:

- Accept life as it is.
    - **Rest with life as it is.**
    - Without judgement.
    - With curiousity, friendliness, patience.
    - (Aside: if acceptance means rest, no wonder I struggle with it so much and [have "rest" as a theme for 2024](/themes/2024/#practice)! ðŸ˜…)
- Meditation is for noticing **the gap between who we are and who we pretend to be.**

## My notes on my notes

- One
    - The Absolute and the Relative are not two different things.
    - Weâ€™re not pieces of whole being. Thereâ€™s only whole being.
- Ordinary
    - Ordinary (mind, life) is the way.
    - Embrace the simple and commonplace. Boring, from the usual point of view.
- Just
    - Just this. Whether you like it or not.
    - Just being, without interfering. Doing nothing except maintaining awareness. Not shutting out thoughts, just not holding on to them.
- Practice
    - Meditation can help us notice the gap between who we are and who we pretend to be.
    - Calm, comfort, pleasure is not the point of practice. Itâ€™s contact with yourself as you are.
    - Lifeâ€™s challenges are inevitable. Seeing them as part of practice makes us stronger.
- Acceptance
    - True peace often comes once we accept, rather than flee from, our most difficult emotions.
    - Donâ€™t run away, analyse it, think about it. Just rest with it, be curious, friendly, patient.
    - Each moment is already perfect.

## Ordinary Mind

> True wisdom is found through embracing the simple and commonplace.

- Knowing is delusion. Not-knowing is a blank consciousness.
- The Way is not a question of knowing or not-knowing.
- Ordinary (mind, life) is the way.
- The Absolute and the Relative are not two different things.
- Just this. Just this very moment.
    - Whether you like it or not.
    - May not be what you had in mind.
- Comfort is already here and now.
- The fact that we think there's something to get is what keeps us miserable.

## The Central Point

> The heart of practice is the recognition that each moment is already perfect.

- The open experience of what is, without anything else interfering.
- No attachment to the thoughts that flow through.

## What is sitting?

> It isn't about a special state. It's about just being, without interfering.

- Sitting is about being what we always aready are.
- Doing nothing except maintaining awareness.
- Boring, from the usual point of view.
- Not shutting out thoughts, just not holding on to them.
- A concentration practice leads to mischief!
- We're all waiting for something, so we resist sitting.

## A substitute life

> Meditation can help us notice the gap between who we are and who we pretend to be.

- We avoid facing our real life, because it hurts.
- When we sit, we can really be ourself.
- Calm, comfort, pleasure is not the point of practice. It's contact with yourself as you are.

## Be what you are

> True peace often comes once we accept, rather than flee from, our most difficult emotions.

- We don't notice things that don't bother us. Difficulties are (therefore) illuminating.
- Don't run away, analyse it, think about it. Just rest with it, be curious, friendly, patient.
- Experience the misery of your life directly.

## A capacity for crisis

> Life's challenges are inevitable. Seeing them as part of practice makes us stronger.

- Shifts almost always occur from crises.
- Practice helps us learn how to deal with crises.
- Make your daily life your practice.

## Whole Being

> All that we see at this second, is just arising.

- We're not pieces of whole being. There's only whole being.
