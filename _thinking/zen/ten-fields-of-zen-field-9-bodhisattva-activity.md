From [Ten Fields of Zen, Field 9 – Bodhisattva Activity: Enacting Vows to Benefit All Beings](https://zenstudiespodcast.com/bodhisattva-activity-ten-fields/)

A Bodhisattva is someone who considers their own spiritual awakening as inseparable from that of other beings.

as a Bodhisattva you are not only promising to care about the welfare of all humans, you are promising to care about any form of life – or even any form – you could conceive of “being.” The impossibility of this task is what gives the vow its power; it will never end but will orient your actions all your life.

you vow to keep moving toward the truth. 

you vow never to embrace complacency by concluding, “good enough.” 

A dedicated Bodhisattva is very ambitious. They are always looking to expand – or at least maintain – their ability to practice diligently and be of benefit to living beings. 

Your creativity and flexibility are continually challenged, and over time you learn to be more effective in your efforts.

Like Avalokiteshvara, you may find yourself overwhelmed by the amount of suffering in the world (or even in your own life), at a loss for what suffering you should address, feeling guilty about not doing more, or discouraged that your efforts have not made more of a difference. What can you do, other than give up? There are two answers to this question – one practical, and one profound.

Practically speaking, you can make your Bodhisattva Activity sustainable by balancing three ingredients in your practice: Bearing Witness, Taking Care, and Taking Action.

if your life is relatively comfortable, it’s your responsibility to expand your circle of concern as wide as you can. 

Frankly, Bearing Witness can be uncomfortable, exhausting, even painful. If there doesn’t seem to be anything you can do to remedy a situation, why would you endure this? Because Bearing Witness is a complete practice unto itself. Your tolerance of discomfort while looking at the suffering of another is an act of profound generosity. If someone knows their suffering is witnessed with compassion and goodwill, they feel less alone – even if no one can help in a tangible way. 

In the moment Taking Care may appear to be a self-centered activity, but ultimately it benefits others because you will be better able to enact generosity if you do things like maintaining your physical health, getting enough sleep, meditating regularly, practicing with Sangha, enjoying your relationships, and engaging in restorative activities.

There is a Zen saying, “It’s easy to be enlightened on a mountaintop.” If your insights don’t translate into your interactions with other living beings, they are incomplete insights or have not yet been fully integrated.

The world has been called “the Bodhisattva’s playground,” not because Bodhisattvas take the suffering of beings lightly but because they delight in benefitting beings, deepening their Realization, and increasing their skillfulness.

The more subtle or profound way to make your Bodhisattva Activity sustainable is keep working on your Realization of Emptiness – or, if you prefer, boundarylessness.

Why, though, does a Bodhisattva care so much about the welfare of beings if they see them as temporary manifestations like waves in the ocean? Because true compassion doesn’t work the way we usually think it does. 

The boundless compassion of a Bodhisattva, however, is described in Buddhism as being like a hand reaching for a pillow in the night.[vii] Think of yourself lying asleep. Your body is experiencing some discomfort. Would you say that, out of compassion, your mind decides you need your pillow, even though you’re unconscious? And then, out of compassion, your arm sacrifices some of its own comfort to reach for the pillow on behalf of your head and shoulders? Should your head and shoulders feel grateful to your arm? Should your arm feel virtuous? Of course not – any sacrifice or benefit is ultimately experienced by your whole body. It doesn’t make any sense to differentiate parts of your body, as if one part is doing another part a favor. Although there is benefit, it is the result of a natural response.

Anything you have to contribute does not originate with you but is the result of an infinite number of supportive causes and conditions.
