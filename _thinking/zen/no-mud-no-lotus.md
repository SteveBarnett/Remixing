## The art of transformative suffering

- When we learn to acknowledge, embrace, and understand of our suffering, we suffer much less.
- We can transform our suffering into understanding, compassion, and joy for ourselves and for others.
- **Suffering and happiness are not separate.** Where there is no suffering, there can be no happiness, and vice versa.
- **If you can recognise and accept your pain without running away from it, you will discover that joy can be there at the same time.**
- Happiness can become suffering and suffering can become happiness again.
- The hardest thing to practice is not becoming overwhelmed by despair.
- Allow the body to test, to release the tension, and heal.

## Saying hello

- We don't stop to take a breath, to even notice if we're suffering - until suddenly the suffering overwhelms us.
- Our thinking, perceiving, and worrying take up all the space inside us.
- Our suffering survives because we enable it and feed it.
- To consume in order to cover up our suffering doesn't work.
- **Most of our thinking is unproductive.**
- We fear being overwhelmed by our suffering, despair, anger, and loneliness, so we run away.
- **The function of mindfulness is to recognise the suffering, then take care of it, embrace it, cradle it with tenderness.**

## Looking deeply

- When we're full of fear, we're often completely focused on preventing the event we dread, missing the joy that's present.
- **Being truly seen eases pain significantly.**
- The situation often calls for understanding and compassion, not blame or punishment.
- **Compassionate listening gives the other person the chance to speak out and suffer less.**

## Ease

- **Happiness is possible immediately - even if it not everything is perfect.**

## Five Practices for nurturing happiness

- **Our idea of happiness can be the main obstacle keeping us from happiness.**
- Letting go; inviting positive seeds; mindfulness; concentration; insight.
- **Letting go can take a lot of courage, but once you let go happiness come quickly.**
- Take care of your suffering by inviting a seed of the opposite nature to come up.
- **Don't ignore your suffering. Just allow the positive seeds already there to get attention and nourishment.**
- "Why do you practice?" "Because I like it."

## Happiness is not an individual matter

- Your body is a collective product of your nation, your people, your people, your ancestors.
- When suffering becomes seemingly impenetrable, draw on the support of others.
- The most precious thing you can offer the person you love is your presence.
- Action pushed by collective anger or fear is not usually Right Action.
- **A toxic environment can bring out the worst things in us.**
- **Compassion is possible in any situation.**

## Practices

- Mental formations always have their objects.
- **The more we let go, the happier we become.**
- Not let go of reality. Let go our of wrong ideas and perceptions about reality.
- **When a painful emotion comes up, stop whatever you're doing and take care of it.**
- The territory of your being is large, one emotion is very little.
- **Feelings flow in us like a river, and ech feeling is a drop of water in that river.**
- "May I be free of attachment and aversion, but not be indifferent."
- **When we believe happiness should take a particular form, we fail to see the opportunities for joy that are right in front of us.**
- The four basic elements of true love are loving kindness, compassion, joy, and inclusiveness.
- **Unmindful consumption causes suffering. It's an attempt to cover up suffering. to lose ourselves.**
- **Practice stopping while you're walking. Then you'll be able to stop when doing other daily activities.**
- **When you walk to the bus stop, or from one room to another, make it a walking meditation.**
- Walk just to enjoy walking, without any desire to arrive anywhere.
