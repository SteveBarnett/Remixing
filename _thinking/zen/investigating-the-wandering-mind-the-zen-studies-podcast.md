Notes from [297 – Investigating the Wandering Mind - The Zen Studies Podcast](https://zenstudiespodcast.com/wandering-mind/).

## Gathered notes

- Quiet mind as in: quiet of other thoughts, not distracted, fully present.
- "Choose to be quiet (about whatever arises)" rather than "apply a technique to achieve a quiet mind".
- Being quiet means
    - facing our uncomfortable feelings, having compassion for our own mind.
    - relaxing our resistance to the situation, our reaction, our desire to be out of the situation.

## Copy-paste highlights

There are many ways to describe the state of mind we seek to cultivate in meditation and mindfulness, but for the sake of this discussion let’s call it a “quiet” mind. This doesn’t mean a mind without thoughts, or even that we will be literally silent. Instead, it means our mind will be free from any extraneous thinking that has nothing to do with our current situation. We cultivate quiet mind not because there’s anything wrong with activity or thinking, but because we want to be fully present for our life as it unfolds. We’re not trying to be mentally quiet all the time, but we want to be able to become quiet at will, and to get used to being quieter in general.

...

Once we identify our aspiration to live with a quieter mind, it’s tempting to set that aspiration up in contrast to our typical mind states. We may imagine that if we try very hard to apply Buddhist practices, our mind will quickly become quiet. This may indeed happen for the rare person, but the vast majority of us are surprised to find how little our efforts seem to affect the content of our minds – whether in terms of subject matter, the sheer quantity of thoughts, or the compelling quality of the thoughts. Unfortunately, this may lead us to conclude we’re no good at practice and then we quit. 

...

Fortunately, no matter the mind you have to work with, you are perfectly capable of practicing quiet mind. Or, more appropriately, you are perfectly capable of being quiet. Phrasing it like this emphasizes the choice to be quiet instead of applying a technique to achieve a quiet mind as judged by the number of thoughts going through it. Even if your mind is full of agitating thoughts, you can be quiet about that. You can refrain from adding any extraneous thoughts to what’s going on.

...

notice if you feel resentment, frustration, sadness, despair, embarrassment, or shame about your experience. Know that facing such feelings and learning to compassionately embrace your own mind is the practice of being quiet. It may require you to let go of some cherished fantasies about what enlightenment should look and feel like, but the reward of this is fully inhabiting your own life.


### Naturally Noisy Mind

Becoming quiet about having a noisy mind is a profound and transformative act of letting go, a transcendence of your small sense of self. And then you can realize it only takes an instant of true quiet to perceive what is most true.

### Negatively Preoccupied Mind

characterized ... by the relentless return of the mind to its subject of preoccupation. It’s not necessarily that the subject itself is negative, but that the experience of preoccupation is negative.

First, we naturally become negatively preoccupied when we are experiencing turmoil in our personal lives or witnessing it in the wider world.

Sometimes people subconsciously think of taking time for meditation or mindfulness as self-indulgent, and this is unfortunate because it often means they will neglect those practices just when they need them most. 

Another reason we may become negatively preoccupied is because of physical or emotional pain. 

it’s possible to be quiet even about this – to relax our resistance to entire situation, including the pain, our reaction to the pain, and our desire to be free from the pain. 

A third reason our minds wander away from the present situation is mental illness

The fourth reason our minds become negatively preoccupied is dwelling on thinking tinged with afflictive emotions like anger, resentment, jealousy, envy, competitiveness, paranoia, pride, or hatred of self or other.

### Excited Mind

Our minds wander away from our current experience because – to put it simply – there’s something we’d rather think about than our current experience!

In some ways, mind wandering due to excitement is harder to let go of than negative preoccupation.

it’s a pivotal part of our practice to spend time being quiet.

### Forgetful Mind

The fourth kind of wandering mind is forgetful mind, where we are unfocused and think aimlessly about this and that.

### Avoidant Mind

The fifth and final kind of wandering mind I want to discuss is avoidant mind, where we find ourselves thinking largely because of our fear of emptiness.

When we realize our mind is resistant to letting go completely, it’s good to be patient and compassionate with ourselves.

Avoidant mind arises because we don’t yet appreciate what emptiness really is. When we gain some personal experience of it, we realize it isn’t a threat. In fact, it is a wonderful return to our true nature.
