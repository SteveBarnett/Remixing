## Pasted notes

### Roam and Play in Samadhi

Play is an energetic activity. It involves enthusiastic engagement with some aspect of life – other living beings, physical objects or terrains, or our own bodies or minds and their capacities. Play generally involves some aspect of challenge, even if it’s easy or lighthearted.

Most of the time we engage in play for its own sake because it’s enjoyable. Synonyms of play include carouse, cavort, clown, dally, frolic, joke, rejoice, revel, delight, and fun.

### The Attitude of Play as an Enlightened State of Mind

The attitude of play is the manifestation of enlightenment – when we carry that attitude into all of our activities.

Imagine we worked selflessly and tirelessly on our bodhisattva vows, but with an attitude of play:

- Throwing all our energy into our activity
- Enthusiastically engaging with other living beings, things, and situations
- Willingly seeking and facing challenge as part of the process
- Immersing ourselves in our activity unconditionally, even if we’re wholeheartedly striving for particular outcomes
- Sincerely enjoying the entire process as something we engage in for its own sake

What if, as we worked, we also had the attitude of roaming:

- Relaxed
- Attentive and curious
- Moving forward to meet and engage the world
- Embracing whatever we encounter – pleasant or unpleasant – as part of the journey

If we are able to bring some of the attitude of play into our everyday activities, not only will our own stress and suffering be decreased, but we will also appreciate our lives much more, be less impatient and reactive, give more unconditionally, and – perhaps most importantly – we’ll be more effective in whatever we do.
