- we have to be careful not to stick our heads too far into the example and lose sight of the point which is being made.
- as long as there is a hope or expectation of some result to be derived from zazen, then zazen is tainted.
- The first time I heard these two expressions I thought to myself, well, finally I can just sit without having to do anything―no more reading, no more having to answer to anyone, no more anything. Needless to say, the conclusion that I had drawn upon hearing Sawaki Rōshi’s remarks was completely off the mark. Zazen is not an escape from the world. Behind Sawaki Rōshi’s statements were many, many years of hard study and practice.
- the significance and ramifications of “just sit” went far beyond the physical act of folding one’s legs and
facing the wall.
- whenever the word “study” appears in Dōgen Zenji’s writings, it is inclusive of or based upon practice.
- Looking deeply into the writings and sutras of past teachers does not mean to learn something that is unrelated to us. Studying ancient writings means to study our lives.
- taking the idea of zazen as the central practice in a relative or comparative sense leads to an egoistical extreme
- On the other hand, taking the idea of zazen in a “broader” context leads to a kind of simplistic eclecticism having nothing to do with zazen.
- In other words, to state that zazen has a definite and particular form, and to cling to that position leads to one kind of trouble, while stating that zazen has no particular form sends one off in another confused direction. There is no logical resolution to this problem. And it is this illogical paradox with which a true practitioner of Zen must “sit,” both literally and spiritually.

## Instructions for the Zen Cook Tenzo Kyōkun

- Put your whole attention into the work, seeing just what the situation calls for.
- Do not be absent-minded in your activities, nor so absorbed in one aspect of a matter that you fail to see its other aspects.
- Maintain an attitude that tries to build great temples from ordinary greens, that expounds the buddhadharma through the most trivial activity.
- Your attitude towards things should not be contingent upon their quality.
- is vital that we clarify and harmonize our lives with our work, and not lose sight of either the absolute or the practical.
- Handle even a single leaf of a green in such a way that it manifests the body of the Buddha. This in turn allows the Buddha to manifests through the leaf.
- do not infringe on the authority of other officers or make decisions outside the boundary of your responsibility.
- If he throws all his energy into whatever the situation truly calls for, then both the activity and the method by which he carries it out will naturally work to nurture the seeds of the buddhadharma
- In preparing food for the community, it is crucial not to grumble about the quality of the ingredients, but rather to cultivate a temper which sees and respects them fully for what they are.
- View the changes of the seasons as a whole, and weigh the relativeness of light and heavy from a broad perspective.

## How to Cook Your Life Jinsei Ryōri no Hon

### ONE The Tenzo Kyōkun and Shikan-taza

- This idea of concentrating wholly on one thing is the cornerstone of the teachings of Dōgen Zenji.
- we assume that there exists a world which you and I experience in common with all other human beings, that this world existed prior to our births, and that it will continue to exist even after our deaths. But again, this is nothing more than an idea.
- My true Self lives in reality, and the world I experience is one I alone can experience, and not one anyone else can experience along with me.
- To express this as precisely as possible, as I am born, I simultaneously give birth to the world I experience; I live out my life along with that world, and at my death the world I experience also dies.
- My personal life experience is at the same time the world of reality. Conversely, the world of reality constitutes my mind.
- if we go about pursuing these thoughts, we are sitting in the zazen posture thinking, and not actually just doing zazen. Trying to get rid of our thoughts is just another form of fantasy.
- Zazen, understood as mind being innately one with all phenomena, is a means of seeing all things from
the foundation of pure life, wherein we give up both pursuing thought and trying to chase it away.
- In the same way that various secretions and hormones flow through the organs of the body, thoughts can be likened to secretions of the mind.

### TWO Concerning the Religious Life

- In Japan, when you say zazen, people generally assume you are talking about something one does in order to gain enlightenment. That sort of idea is far removed from the zazen of Dōgen Zenji.
- To have goodness emanating naturally from your character is living more truly by Buddhism than having had some so-called kenshō or satori experience.
- A satori which is unrelated to your personal character is nothing more than a kind of drunkenness.
- Your practice of zazen must not be something separate from your own experience of your day-to-day life, nor from the overall direction of your life.

### THREE The True Form of the Self

- may be a fact existing as a thought or feeling in your heart, but it is not valid to equate a fact, as real as it may seem to be, with the truth. It is just self deception, and we deceive ourselves by believing that a fact existing in our minds is absolute truth.
- As long as big is something set in opposition to small, it is always going to be an inconclusive thing.
- In our day-to-day lives, it is impossible to live without discriminating between good and evil, likes and dislikes.
- We cannot act without selecting or discriminating.

### FOUR Everything You Encounter Is Your Life

- The mistake is that although there is only a partial or superficial communication going on between people, we throw our lives completely into that, failing to see ourselves as anything more than members of that world.
- our thought-producing minds are nothing more than one aspect of our total lives.
- You and the totality of the world you live in together constitute that which I have been calling the life of the Self.
- The “world,” is not some entity which exists apart from us; the “world” is where we function. Likewise, the life of the true Self is not some entity apart from our functioning and working. Everything we encounter is our life.

### FIVE Seeing the World Without Holding Worldly Values

- see the four seasons of favorable circumstances, adversity, despair, and exhalation all as the scenery of your life.
- everything―in this case, even misfortune―is our life, what is essential especially in these circumstances is to meet adversity with an attitude of equanimity. If we fall into hell, then we need the resolve to see that hell is our home. When we are being boiled in the demon’s cauldron, that is where we have to do zazen.
- When we throw all our life energy into whatever we might encounter, no demon can help but retreat.
- We view heaven or hell, enlightenment or delusion all with the same eye, or to put it more positively, we throw our whole lives into whatever we encounter, and that is the attitude of living out the buddhadharma.

### SIX On Parental Mind

- When our way of life accords with the buddhadharma, we no longer construct a world in opposition to what we think of as our “self.” Rather, we see that the whole world is the true Self.
- Big Mind, then, is not a matter of meditating on some vast, floating, spatial dimension. Rather, it is the practice of entirely devoting your life to each and every thing that you encounter, no matter what it might be.
- The wonderful point of Dōgen Zenji’s practice of zazen is that it is religion which must function concretely in one’s daily life.
- We should always strive to treat objects, affairs, and particularly people, with good care.

### EIGHT Direction and Goal

- Middle Way does not mean halfway. Nor does it mean some sort of watered-down, defeated compromise or shallow eclecticism. Rather, Middle Way means to accept this contradiction of impermanence and cause and effect within your own life. To accept this contradiction means to forbear and overcome it without trying to resolve it.
- To express this concretely in terms of our daily attitude, it means to live without projecting goals while yet having a direction.

### NINE Making Life Calculations

- we seek happiness because we have fixed on the idea that we are not happy now.

### TEN Working with Clear Vision

- if we become attached to the idea that everything is impermanent and nothing is fixed, then we have fallen into the trap of trying to fix something.
- our “self” occurs at the juncture of what is relatively fixed and what cannot be fixed.
- What, then, is this body? Truly, it is neither an entity that is fixed, nor is it something undefined.
- There will always be that complaining and unsatisfied aspect of the self with which we have to deal. The dharma is not going to become manifest only after we have somehow brought this aspect under control or stamped it out. The function of the dharma and of zazen is to care for the obstreperous aspect of ourselves in the same way a mother lulls her baby to sleep.

### ELEVEN Living Through the Life of the Self

- we have to live out our own lives, and we have to learn to encounter whatever comes up without avoiding difficulties. This is the spirit of magnanimity which Dōgen Zenji has referred to as daishin, or Big Mind.
- to meet all the experiences of our lives with our eyes open, and to act with a true sense of caring for them all is referred to as rōshin, or Parental Mind.
- no matter what circumstances we fall into, we have no real choice but to live through it by ourselves.
- there is no stability to be found in life other than living it out as it is,
- The degree of separation from the reality of life appears as suffering and struggling.

###  TWELVE On Life Force and Life Activity

- Practicing the Buddha Way or practicing zazen is never a matter of putting aside our day-to-day activities to search for truth in some mystical realm, nor does it mean to look for truth through some scholarly research.
- the spirit running throughout the text is clearly that of functioning with a clear mind and true sincerity in the actual situation in which we find ourselves, and not in that one we have merely fabricated in our minds.

### THIRTEEN The Function of a Settled Life

- When I use the term Self, I am not referring to some fixed entity; the Self is life, and life is functioning.

### FOURTEEN Throwing Your Life into the Abode of the Buddha

- the “abode of the Buddha” is nothing other than our own lives. Consequently, there is no refuge, no special place outside the life of our true Self, nor anything apart from the activities of that Self.
- the way of life of one living the buddhadharma is, at the most fundamental level, just living the life of the Self without searching outside oneself for something.
- You should remember and know thoroughly that dharma turns the Self [all phenomena influence us] and that the self turns dharma [we influence all dharma or phenomena].
- “There is nothing in the world that is hidden.” This is derived from the expression hengai fuzōzō, meaning that the truth of life manifests itself in all places and in all things, just as they are.
- the Japanese expression sanshin, or literally, three minds or attitudes. Kishin is a joyful mind;rōshin is the mind or attitude of a parent towards a child; while daishin is having a magnanimous or “big” mind.
- “Hungry ghost” is a literal translation of the Japanese word gaki. Ga means to be famished or hungry, and ki means a demon or ghost. In the context of Zen Buddhism, gaki refers to that which arises inside us human beings, and which is never satisfied with what we are or what we have.
