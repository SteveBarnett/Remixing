- Before we can listen to another person well, we need to spend some time listening to ourselves
- Listen to what emotions are rising up, **without judging or interrupting them**
- When we stop the busyness of the mind and come back to ourselves, our suffering can seem very intense. This is because **we are so used to ignoring it and distracting ourselves from the pain.**
- We are with whatever is there without being carried away by it. **We let it come, let it stay, then let it go.**
- "When you are able to see the source of nutriment that has brought something to be, you are already on the path of emancipation."
- When we **let go of our opinions and views**–**when we create space**–then what others say can truly penetrate
- We should practice not to allow the unbeneficial seeds to manifest. We allow them to sleep quietly and peacefully down in the store consciousness.
- A rose is made of non-rose elements. What do we see in the rose? We see the cloud, the rain, the sunshine, the soil, the minerals, the gardener. **If we were to remove the non-rose elements, there would be on no rose left.**
- As long as there's a self who's comparing, you will suffer
- We use the word "view", but more precisely we mean **the abandoning of all views**. We could say that the **Right View is no view**. Right View removes all the points of view, because truth cannot be described in these terms. **A point of view is always partial.**
- The truth of nonduality is apparent in all phenomena: left and right, above and below, good and bad, well-being and ill-being are all interconnected
- Our person is made of our body, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness. The territory is large. you are much more than just one emotion. This is the insight you gain when a string emotion comes up.
- **Practice right now, while the sky is clear and there are no storms on the horizon**
