<span lang="ja">Shikantaza</span>: “just sitting”. The “just” means:

- nothing else but;
- only sitting;
- not turning away.

"Not turning away" means:

- letting go of trying to control experience;
- not judging your experience;
- giving everything that arises a warm welcome.

Don’t do anything but sit there. You only need to sit. Just allow the sitting to take place.

Sit like a mountain.

## Unproductive

The "just" means no “in order to.”

- No attachment to a particular outcome.
- No intention to gain something.
- No goal or ulterior motive.

Enjoy your sitting deeply. Practice for the simple delight in the practice. Open, receptive, alert, in the same you played when you were a child.

Being instead of doing.

## Wu wei

- Flow without forcing or coercing.
- Act without acting on, work without working at.
- Avoid assertion, practice inaction.
- Effortless action as in: no sense of self taking action.

## The Way

- Actions are changes made by a self-conscious agent, a manifestation of purpose. So the Tao has no actions. 
- Choosing obscures the way.
- Language has evolved to describe purposive action, making it hard to describe spontaneous, actionless, activity.
- The Tao is the source, the unconditioned prior to conditioning.
