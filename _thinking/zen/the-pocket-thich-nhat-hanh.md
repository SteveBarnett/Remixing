## 1. Mindfulness

- Your true home is the here and the now.
- **Be like the peeble reaching the bed of the river without making any effort.**
- Recognise the habit and it loses its energy, and it can't push us anymore.
- With mindfulness, we can spend time with difficult feelings without running away.
- **Don't be in a hurry to find the source of bad feelings, to make them disappear; just illuminate them.**
- Awareness is a tolerant and lucid precense, never violent or discriminating.

## 2. Enlightenment

- **The deeper we look into any thing, the more we see its interbeing.**
- **To be is to inter-be.**
- Don't wait until you have no more suffering before allowing yourself to be happy.
- Embrace your suffering, and let it reveal to you the way of peace.
- Impermanence is more than an idea. It's a practice to help us touch reality.
- From the point of view of time, we say impermanence. From the point of view of space, we say non-self.
- What makes us suffer is wanting things to be permanent when they are not.
- Your purpose is to be yourself.
- There is neither birth nor death. There is only manifestation, appearance.
- Existence and non-existence are just concepts. There is only manifestation and nonmanifestation, which depend on our perception.
- You cannot reduce being into nonbeing.
- The Three Doors of Liberation: emptiness; signlessness (appearance); aimlessness. (we already are what we want to become).
- Buddhist teachings don't sit outside us; they're medicine for our ills, they're skillful means to cure our ignorance, craving, and anger.

## 3. Emotions and Relatioships

- **Running away doesn't end our suffering; it only prolongs it.**
- Our painful feelings are a part of us. To deny them is to deny our very selves.
- You are much more than your emotions.
- We do everything we can to avoid confronting our true selves.
- We need the eyes of understanding, of wisdom, to be an effective instrument of compassion.
- Deep understanding is the substance of which true love is made.
- If we have not been able to embrace and transform our own hurt and anger, it will be difficult to listen to another's suffering.
- **Our good intentions can evaporate when we're unable to handle the pain welling up within ourselves.**
- "Even if you are sure, check again."

## 4. Peace

- Peace, stability, and freedom always seek a way to express themselves in action.
- When we are armed with compassion and understanding we fight not against other people but the tendency to invade, dominate, and exploit.
- People only speak or act out when they're suffering.
- When we look closely at the other side, we see that they are just like us.
- We don't need a special effort, we don't need to practice, to enjoy the beauty of the blue sky.
