## Gathered notes

- **Zen is largely apophatic: it affirms by emphasising what is not**
    - because of our tendency to conceptualise, reify, concretise
    - the teachings delineate, encircle, a negative space
- **Direct, personal, experience, not an intellectual understanding**
    - Reality quickly escapes any box we try and put it in
    - But words can be good pointers
- Contradictions occur in concepts, not in Reality
    - **Many teachings simultaneously defy the intellect and resonate with the heart**
- Reality is all, including you
- There is no Reality apart from the myriad manifestations of the universe, including your personal self
- **The koan of what it means to know something is central to the process of deepening your connection to Reality**


## Raw highlights

### Zen Teachings on the Ineffable

- in Zen we are very careful about teaching and talking about That Which Is Greater. Any words used to describe Reality-with-a-Capital-R tempt us to form an intellectual understanding of It instead of pursuing a direct, personal experience of It. An intellectual understanding is not inherently bad and may be a source of strength and inspiration, but the spiritual solace you truly long for is experiential and not based on holding a particular view – even a positive one.
- Still, words can be compassionate pointers that get you going in the right direction.
- despite Emptiness, “there is something which, in the limitlessness, establishes the [bodhi-]mind.” Bodhi-mind is Bodhicitta, our Way-Seeking Mind. 
- you recognize that you are an intimate and essential part of a vast, seamless whole that is shining with aliveness throughout. There is a sense that everything is exactly as it should be – that everything is aligned. Your individuality is powerfully affirmed even though it is free from any inherent essence that needs to fear death. 
- You are not part of the Ineffable in spite of being your personal self, or in addition to being your personal self. There is no Ineffable apart from the myriad manifestations of the universe, including your personal self. Just as the Ineffable shines through a beautiful piece of music, it shines through you.

### Killing the Ineffable by Sticking It in a Box

- the Ineffable quickly escapes from any box you make for it.
- Our tendency to conceptualize or reify (make concrete) that which is beyond words is why Zen is largely an apophatic spiritual tradition. A cataphatic spiritual tradition celebrates and affirms the divine explicitly, while an apophatic tradition points to That Which Is Greater by emphasizing what it is not.
- if you stick with the practice long enough, you’ll realize the teachings circumscribe a negative space – an entry gate through which you are encouraged to walk.

### Connecting with the Ineffable in Zen

- When Emptiness teachings seem to contradict the Ineffable, it’s because you’re trying to grasp them with the discriminating mind, which is inherently dualistic. With discriminating mind, you can only imagine Emptiness means non-existence and lack of meaning, or oneness nullifies individuality, or vastness diminishes that which is small. In Reality, there is no contradiction.
- It should not be hard for you to find something in the traditional teachings which simultaneously defies your intellectual understanding and sets up a resonance within your heart
- When you experience the nondual, it’s important to understand the significance of it. You have glimpsed what is more true than the everyday world of appearances. You should let what you have perceived change and guide you.

### How Can You Know the Ineffable?

- The koan of what it means to know something is central to the process of deepening your connection to the Ineffable.
