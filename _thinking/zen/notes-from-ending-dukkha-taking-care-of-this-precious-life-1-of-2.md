## Gathered notes

- Dukkha is the existential angst we add to our experiences of pain, discomfort, unease, longing.
    - It's caused by resistance to reality, to how things are.
- Dukkha often feels worse than the experience it’s attached to.
- Dukkha can create more Dukkha, lasting long after the original experience.
- The underlying cause is false views. Such as....
    - There is something inherently wrong with you.
    - There is something inherently wrong with other people.
    - The life choices you have made require you to carry a burden of shame.

## Raw notes

The Role of Dukkha in Our Life and Practice.

1. The primary purpose of Buddhist practice is to end Dukkha.
2. Dukkha has a range of manifestations from subtle uneasiness to acute anguish.
3. Physical and emotional pain, discomfort, and longing are an inevitable part of human life, while Dukkha is existential angst we add to our experiences.
    - Once you become better able to discern between these experiences, you realize that, in many cases, your Dukkha feels much worse than the unpleasant experience it’s attached to. Not only that, Dukkha can create more Dukkha, creating an ongoing cycle of stress and suffering that can continue long after the original stimulus has passed.
4. Dukkha is caused by your mental resistance to the way things are.
5. Dukkha is a symptom of underlying spiritual illness that can be cured because the cause of such illness is false views.
    - Here is a sample of views which can trigger your mental resistance and therefore cause Dukkha:
        - There is something inherently wrong with you.
        - There is something inherently wrong with other people (they can’t be trusted, or they’re out to get you).
        - ...
        - If you can only figure out how to communicate your needs to your loved ones, they will meet those needs and you’ll be happy.
        - The life choices you have made require you to carry a burden of shame.
    - Buddhism promises us that if the view is causing Dukkha, it is false.
6. Buddhism offers a holistic approach to alleviating Dukkha, including maximizing our overall spiritual health, working with our karma, and curing its ultimate cause.
7. Even when our Dukkha is not extreme, it is a sign of lingering false views, so we continue to pay close attention to it and seek to end it.
