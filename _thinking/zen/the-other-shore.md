## Summary of the summary

- All phenomena are products of **interdependent co-arising**.
- **To be is to inter-be**. Every *thing* is made of *non-thing* elements.
- Everything is empty. **Empty of a fixed, separate, self-nature.**
- Including the Path, insight, and attainment.
    - Emptiness in space is interbeing. Emptiness in time is impermanence.
- Being on the Path, chasing and grasping after something, means having to wait to be happy.
- **Every step must be happy**, the process/means must be happy for the ends to be happy.
- **No birth. No death. Only change and continuation.**
- Polarities are just ideas, they don't correspond to Reality.
    - Like being and non-being.
    - Something can’t become nothing. Nothing can’t become something.

## Summary

- When we encounter polarities we tend to believe that one must be right and the other wrong.
- But all phenomena are products of interdependent co-arising.
- They do not, can not, have a fixed, separate, existence/self-entity. No self-nature.
    - Empty means empty of something. Empty of a fixed, separate, independent self.
    - Empty of a separate self means full of everything.
- The Path, insight, and attainment are also not separate self-entities. They co-arise, interdependently. As a result of many causes and conditions.
    - We think the path and the goal are separate.
    - The idea of the path leading to happiness reveals a dualistic way of thinking.
    - When we're on the path we have to wait for the end of the path to be happy.
    - But every step on the path must be happy.
    - The process that gives rise to happiness has to also be happy.
    - If the means are unhappy, the ends will be unhappy.
    - As long as we grasp or run after something, we'll never experience it.
- Another example: sight arises contemporaneously with eyes and form.
- To be is to inter-be. Every thing is made of non-thing elements.
- Impermanence is crucial for the life of everything.
- Looking from the perspective of space we call emptiness “interbeing”; looking from the perspective of time we call it “impermanence.”
    - (No edges, no centre. No fixity.)
- The day the day you were born is just the day you manifested in this form.
- There is no birth. There is not death. There is only change and continuation.
- (Don't forget) Something can't become nothing. Nothing can't become something.
    - The categories of being and non-being do not correspond to reality.
- Everything interpenetrates. Inside and outside are just ideas, they don't apply to Reality.
- We need to transcend all pairs of opposites, all duality, to touch the Absolute.
    - Interbeing has no opposite, so it can help us get there.
- Everything contains everything else: interbeing and interpenetration.

## Notes from [The Other Shore: A New Translation of the Heart Sutra with Commentaries by Thich Nhat Hanh](https://plumvillage.org/about/thich-nhat-hanh/letters/thich-nhat-hanh-new-heart-sutra-translation)

- Prajñāpāramitā (Perfect Understanding)
- Buddhism, in order to be Buddhism, must be suitable, appropriate to the psychology and the culture of the society that it serves.
- In the thirteenth century, Zen Master Eihei Dōgen taught that enlightenment is just intimacy with all things.

### foreword to the new translation and commentaries

- Thay titled his translation of the Heart Sutra as “The Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore.”
- interbeing, no-self, the Middle Way, emptiness, signlessness, and aimlessness.

### author’s preface The Cloud and the Cave

- As long as we keep this traditional wording, novices still risk getting their noses twisted.
- When we encounter polarities, or pairs of opposites, we have the tendency to believe that one must be right and the other wrong.
- All phenomena are products of interdependent co-arising; they do not have a separate self.
- They cannot exist on their own; they have to inter-exist.
- Emptiness means only the emptiness of self, not the nonbeing of self, just as when a balloon is empty inside it doesn’t mean that the balloon doesn’t exist.

### The Heart Sutra: The Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore NEW TRANSLATION BY THICH NHAT HANH, AUGUST 2014

> all phenomena bear the mark of Emptiness: their true nature is the nature of no Birth no Death, no Being no Nonbeing, no Defilement no Purity, no Increasing no Decreasing.<br>
> not separate self-entities.<br>
> the Path, insight, and attainment are also not separate self-entities.

### One: Interbeing

- The insight of interbeing can help us understand
- the teachings on emptiness more clearly.
- To be is to inter-be.
- the sheet of paper is made entirely of “non-paper elements” and if we were to return any one of these non-paper elements to their source, there would be no paper at all.

### Two: Empty of What?

- Empty means empty of something.
- “Empty of what?” we ask. And this was the reply: “They are empty of a separate self.”
- No matter how wonderful something is, when we look deeply into it, we see that there is nothing in it we can identify as a separate self.
- When Avalokiteśvara says that our sheet of paper is empty, the bodhisattva means it is empty of a separate independent existence.
- empty of a separate self means full of everything.
- Avalokiteśvara looked deeply into the five skandhas and discovered that none of them can be by itself alone. Each can only inter-be with all the others.

### Three: The Way of Understanding

- When we want to understand something, we cannot just stand outside and observe it. We have to enter deeply into it and become one with it in order to really understand.
- The sutra uses the word “realization” to mean “full or perfect comprehension.”

### Four: Long Live Emptiness

- this Body itself is Emptiness and Emptiness itself is this Body. This Body is not other than Emptiness, and Emptiness is not other than this Body.
- It is precisely because our body is emptiness that it can manifest. Our body is full of everything, full of life.
- If you look deeply at your body, you can see your parents, your grandparents, all your ancestors, and the whole history of life on Earth.
- Only one thing is missing from our body, and that is a separate self, a separate existence.
- This is the true meaning of emptiness. Our body does not have a separate existence.
- Emptiness simply means no self-nature.
- emptiness, when understood rightly, is the absence of any ontological ground. To turn emptiness into an ontological essence, to call it the ground of all that is, is not correct. Emptiness is not an eternal, unchanging ontological ground.
- Emptiness is impermanence; it is change.
- Impermanence is crucial for the life of everything.

### Five: The Mark of Emptiness

- there is no self, there is no permanent soul, there is nothing unchanging, but there is continuation.
- In this context, Avalokiteśvara represents the intention of the Mahāyāna to restore the original teaching of the Buddha on the emptiness of all phenomena, whereas Śāriputra represents the abhidharma: the stratified and analytical teachings that had come to dominate schools of Buddhist philosophy like the Sarvāstivāda.
- The insight of interbeing is that nothing can exist by itself alone, that each thing exists only in relation to everything else.
- Interbeing means emptiness of a separate self, however impermanence also means emptiness of a separate self. Looking from the perspective of space we call emptiness “interbeing”; looking from the perspective of time we call it “impermanence.” (SB: no edges, no center)

### Six: Happy Continuation

- even before your conception you were already there. Half the elements that make up you were inside your mother and the other half in your father, not only in terms of genes and chromosomes, but in the form of thoughts, beliefs, qualities, and talents
- The day your mother gave birth to you is not the day you were born. It is just the day you manifested in this form.
- There is no birth; there is only continuation.
- It is a formation, the manifestation of many causes and conditions coming together.
- It is impossible for something to become nothing.
- Your ancestors were not only alive in the past; they are here in the present moment, still alive in you. You are their continuation. They have not died.
- Studying the Heart Sutra, we can find insight into our actual situation and liberate ourselves from our afflictions, suffering, and fear.

### Seven: Can You See the Sunflowers?

- We say that there isn’t a single sunflower here because we can’t see all the latent causes and conditions lying in wait. We have the tendency to think that, as long as we can’t see the sunflowers, they don’t exist, and that once we can see the sunflowers, they suddenly do exist.
- the two categories of being and nonbeing do not correspond to reality.
- The Buddha teaches very clearly that when something manifests it does not come from anywhere, and when it no longer manifests it does not go anywhere. It is not born. It does not die. It does not pass from the realm of being into the realm of nonbeing.
- At the level of conventional truth these pairs of opposites are everywhere.
- At the level of conventional truth there is discrimination and separation.
- the ultimate truth, that things are really inside of each other.
- everything interpenetrates, so the notions of inside and outside do not apply.
- No birth and no death; no being and no nonbeing; no coming and no going; no same and no different, are known as the Eight Negations.
- The traditional Chinese and Sanskrit versions of the Heart Sutra do not mention “no being and no nonbeing.”
- In order to touch the ultimate truth, we need to transcend all pairs of opposites—all duality. I have added “no being” and “no nonbeing” in this new translation
- The view of “being” is one extreme view, and the view of “nonbeing” is another extreme view. We need to transcend both these notions. The term interbeing can help.
- Interbeing has no opposite, so we can make use of it to avoid falling into the trap of dualistic thinking.

### Eight: Roses and Garbage

- We are imprisoned by our ideas of good and evil. We want only good, and we want to remove all evil. But that is because we forget that good is made of non-good elements
- We may say we want only the left, and we do not want the right, and there is trouble right away.
- in the light of non-duality, there is no problem: as soon as the idea of good is there, the idea of evil is there.

### Nine: The Moon Is Always the Moon

- There is a Chinese proverb that says: “To say you don’t know is the beginning of true knowledge.”
- if we are able to look from the point of view of Mother Earth, with the insight of no-increasing and no-decreasing, we have a chance to transcend our fear and wake up.
- ideas of big and small are just concepts in our mind.
- Everything contains everything else; that is the principle of interbeing and interpenetration.

### Ten: What’s in a Name?

- As humans, we are made of non-human elements.
- That is why to protect humanity, we have to protect animals, plants, and minerals. That is the teaching of the Diamond Sutra, the most ancient text on deep ecology.
- We can release the name and dwell in the truth of emptiness. This is the teaching on conventional designation.
- Signlessness doesn’t mean that there are no signs; it means that we don’t get caught by their appearance.
- the Diamond Sutra says that “wherever there is a sign, there is a deception.”
- Even the sign or mark of emptiness must be abandoned in order to touch the insight of emptiness, in order to touch the true nature of reality in itself, “suchness.”

### Eleven: Stars Are Consciousness

- Eyes are just one of the conditions that make sight possible. Many other conditions are also necessary, like light, form, time, space, optic nerve, brain, and so on. It is not correct to make “eyes” the subject of the verb “to see.” Sight arises contemporaneously with eyes and form.
- Looking at the perceived we see the perceiver.

### Twelve: Everything Is a Formation

- The ideas of reincarnation, karmic retribution, and saṃsāra (the cycle of birth and death), did not originate with the Buddha.
- Buddhism adopted the teachings of karma and saṃsāra, but modified them in important ways.
- Interdependent arising is a fundamental Buddhist teaching describing the manifestation of phenomena. All things arise in mutual dependence on one another, as a result of the coming together of many causes and conditions.
- That is the traditional way of presenting the nidānas. When taught in this way, the twelve links aim to explain reincarnation and rebirth, but do not help us touch the ultimate dimension.
- All things are formations
- Anything that is formed by the coming together of everything else is a formation. That is why the word “formation” is a very good English translation of saṃskāra.
- As the notions of birth and death always go along with the notions of being and nonbeing, it is a shortcoming of the traditional presentation to blame suffering on being.
- we suffer not because of being, but because of the notions of being and nonbeing.
- We can simplify this idea with just five links: delusion > formations (as separate self-entities) > birth-death > being-nonbeing > saṃsāra
- The Heart Sutra reminds us that the links are not separate self-entities. There is not a linear progression between them. They all inter-cause each other.
- They all arise together in dependence upon one another.
- the ultimate truth, can manifest: wisdom > formations (without self) > no birth–no death > no being–no nonbeing > nirvāṇa

### Thirteen: The Path of Happiness

- being, the causes of ill-being, the end of ill-being, the path… are also not separate self-entities. The First Noble Truth is called duḥkha, which translates as ill-being or suffering.
- The Four Noble Truths are not only about suffering; they are also about happiness.
- it’s not that suffering doesn’t exist, but that suffering doesn’t exist by itself. Suffering inter-exists with the other three Noble Truths. Although we can touch a place in our consciousness that is beyond happiness and suffering, this does not mean the nonexistence of happiness and suffering. As long as there are human beings and the human mind, happiness and suffering will continue to manifest.
- we have an idea of a goal and of a path that leads to that goal, and we think they are two different things.
- The idea of the path leading to happiness reveals a dualistic way of thinking.
- so for as long as we are on the path we cannot be happy; we have to wait until the end of the path to have happiness. In our minds, the path is the means and happiness is the end.
- The truth is that the path is happiness itself. The Noble Eightfold Path is not a path of hardship, difficulty, or self-mortification. It is a path on which every step we take can be happy.
- The process that gives rise to peace has to also be peace. The use of violence and guns in the name of peace cannot be right,
- If the means are violent, the ends will also be violent.

### Fourteen: Chasing Butterflies

- Insight is made of non-insight elements.
- As long as we grasp or run after them, we shall never experience them.
- What you run toward is just the idea of enlightenment.
- running toward what you think is good is still running, and so you will still suffer. Life in the present moment is already wonderful enough.
- The Buddha nature is present in its entirety in the nature of a human being. You do not need to become something, because you already are what you want to become.
- If you’re still demanding something, thinking it’s essential to your happiness, or rushing around in search of something, then you are still caught in the idea of attainment.

### Fifteen: Freedom

- If you consider something to be the truth, and if you are attached to that, you are caught.
- Knowledge is the first obstacle of the mind that a meditator should be able to remove. We should not be too sure of anything.

### Sixteen: No Longer Afraid

- Our ideas of what will make us happy may be the very obstacles to our happiness.
- We have been nirvanized from the non-beginning.

### Seventeen: Who Is Enlightened?

- If you practice mindfulness and concentration you may get insight, or enlightenment, several times a day.
- Enlightenment, to me, is a deep understanding of our true situation.
- everything is impermanent, including insight and compassion.
- Nothing is permanent, even enlightenment, even happiness and liberation.
- you do not have to have a self in order for there to be study, practice, and enlightenment.
- nirvāṇa is the ground of all formations and phenomena, just like the ocean is the ground of all waves and clouds.

### Conclusion: A Tangerine Party

- In Buddhist meditation we do not struggle for the kind of enlightenment that will happen five or ten years from now. We practice so that each moment of our life becomes real life.
- When we meditate, we sit just for sitting; we don’t sit for something else.
