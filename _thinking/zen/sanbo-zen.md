(A quick little bit of research on Sanbo Zen)

- Zen practice for lay practitioners
- Priority on kenshō, realising true self
- Through zazen
- And the embodiment of kenshō in daily life

## [Sanbo Kyodan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanbo_Kyodan)

Sanbō Kyōdan, literally "Three Treasures Religious Organization") is a lay Zen school derived from both the Soto (Caodong) and the Rinzai (Linji) traditions. It was renamed Sanbo-Zen International in 2014.

Both Harada Roshi and Yasutani Roshi were strong promoters of Zen practice for lay practitioners, and for people of other (non-Buddhist, non-Asian) faith communities and cultures. Their openness to lay practitioners was in line with the modernizing tendency of the Meiji Restoration, which began in 1868.

One early American Zen member was Philip Kapleau.

 The primary objectives were:

- To bring back the actual experience of deep awakening—the heart of Zen—as a central focus.
- To that end, to offer intensive koan study along the lines formulated by Hakuin Zenji in the 1700’s.
- To make the training available to lay practitioners.

## [Sanbo Zen International](https://sanbo-zen-international.org/)

Sanbo Zen is a lay lineage of Zen practice, based in Kamakura, Japan, which combines its Soto heritage with a program of Rinzai koan study.

Sanbo Zen puts utmost priority on Kenshō (見性)—the actual, direct experience of the True Self—and its embodiment in daily life. 

## [The Fundamental Position of the SANBÔZEN](https://ssl.sanbo-zen.org/position_e.html)

"The fundamental position of the SANBÔZEN is to stand at the origin point of Buddhism through the Dharma gate of Dôgen Zenji."

The purpose of our practice is to follow the footsteps of Shakyamuni through correct zazen practice and to realize our true nature. ... we aim to eradicate our attachment to enlightenment as such and keep making endless efforts to let our true self manifest itself in our personality and daily life. This is what is meant by "the Dharma gate of Dôgen Zenji."

In the Way of Zen, handed down through the buddhas and ancestors in the past, the way to actualize this great aim is traditionally established in a concrete and distinct manner - that is zazen. It is the ultimate aim of the SANBÔZEN to contribute to steadily realizing true and everlasting peace among all people through this actual practice of zazen.
