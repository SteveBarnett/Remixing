Notes from [Living Beautifully with Uncertainty and Change by Pema Chödrön](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13414918-living-beautifully-with-uncertainty-and-change)

## Summarised notes

- Our attempts to find fixed, static, lasting states are at odds with the dynamic, processual, reality of everything and everyone
    - We incorrectly believe a constant security and well-being is the ideal state
- The fundamental anxiety of being human, the fundamental ambiguity of being human: the visceral experience of feeling that things aren't right
    - Most of us go from one promise of relief to another, never staying with the pain long enough to learn anything from it
- A commitment to see everything we encounter, good and bad, pleasant and painful, as a manifestation of awakened energy
    - Instead of trying to avoid the discomfort, open yourself completely to it
    - See the feelings as road signs, barometers
    - We need strong motivation to stick with it because the desire to escape is so compelling
- Fixed identity means fixed ideas about ourselves and about things we perceive
- Interrupting thoughts isn’t the same as repressing them, it's somewhere between clinging to them and pushing them away
    - In the middle between two extremes
    - Refraining but not repressing
- We can't get rid of thoughts. Thinking thoughts is what the mind does.
- Compassionate self-reflection.
    - Make friends with yourself as you are, not as you wish you are, or think you out to be, honestly and kindly.
    - You're a good person with temporary, malleable, habits that are causing you suffering
    - Don't strengthen rigidity or self-criticism

## The First Commitment - Committing to Not Cause Harm

- The first commitment is about refraining from speech and actions that are harmful to ourselves and others
- Noticing our patterns, and making a decision not to follow it to an exit, chasing cravings, aggression, or indifference
- Each time we act out, we're strengthening an old escape habits and routes.
    - Notice what you do when you’re unhappy or dissatisfied and want to feel better
- Each time we refrain, we feeling the underlying uncertainty, anxiety, restlessness
- Our interconnectedness makes our situation inescapable.

## The Second Commitment - Committing to Take Care of One Another

- Awakening is a process of letting go, relaxing in the middle
- Move into the pain of the world to help alleviate it
- Cultivate courage and flexibility to live with uncertainty
- We can only face others feelings to the degree that we can face our own
- We'll always have bad feelings. We'll always have pain. We'll always have this uncertainty.
- Life is full of opportunities for us to try again
- Compassion is mutual support of equals

## The Third Commitment - Committing to Embrace the World Just as It Is

- The feeling of nowhere to hide can be quite intense
- There's no escape from our experience, nowhere to go
- We can't transcend our life. We can only contact it fully.
- It's only by fully being in the Relative that can touch the Absolute
- When we do turn away it's because of timing and not from running away, avoiding
- The sweetness of life and the harshness of life complement each other.
    - Splendidness provides vision and wretchedness grounds us.
- One sign of the practice is moving towards, being curious about, strong feelings
- Our old habits are worthy opponents
- When we can be fully present with an emotion, we see how fleeting it it
- Modern life triggers high anxiety and restlessness, creating the ideal enviroment for practice

- a commitment to see everything we encounter, good and bad, pleasant and painful, as a manifestation of awakened energy.
- Under the illusion that experiencing constant security and well-being is the ideal state, we do all sorts of things to try to achieve it.
- This discomfort, this sense of being triggered because things are not “right,” because we want them to last longer or to go away, is the felt experience, the visceral experience of the fundamental ambiguity of being human.
- Instead of trying to avoid the discomfort, you open yourself completely to it
- Ego or fixed identity doesn’t just mean we have a fixed idea about ourselves. It also means that we have a fixed idea about everything we perceive
- instead of thinking of these feelings as bad, we could think of them as road signs or barometers that tell us we’re in touch with groundlessness
- interrupting thoughts isn’t the same as repressing them
- Interrupting thoughts is somewhere between clinging to them and pushing them away
- Thoughts always come back. That’s the nature of mind
- Getting rid of thought altogether. That would be impossible
- Continuing to recycle the old story line is a way of avoiding fundamental ambiguity
- make friends with yourself—to be honest with yourself and kind

### The First Commitment - Committing to Not Cause Harm

- this commitment protects us from falling into or chasing after unnecessary cravings, unnecessary aggression, and unnecessary indifference
- The first commitment supports us in not escaping into our old patterns—in seeing very clearly that we’re about to exit, then making a conscious decision not to do it.
- The first commitment is about refraining from speech and actions that are harmful to ourselves and others
- following the precepts gives us space to examine every nuance of the urge to express ourselves negatively and then, while fully acknowledging our feelings
- It’s important, however, to refrain in a spirit of compassionate self-reflection.
- good person with temporary, malleable habits that are causing you a lot of suffering
- Each time we don’t refrain but speak or act out instead, we’re strengthening old habits. when we refrain, we’re allowing ourselves to feel the underlying uncertainty—that edgy, restless energy—without trying to escape
- allowing us to see clearly what our escape routes are and enabling us not to take them
- we’re either speaking or acting in order to escape, or we’re not.
- Do this with the intention that it will put you in touch with the underlying anxiety or uncertainty that you’ve been avoiding.
- Our situation is inescapable because of our interconnectedness with all things.
- let it be there just as it is, without labeling it good or bad, without telling yourself you should or shouldn’t be feeling that way
- It’s important to have a kind attitude as we meditate, to train in making friends with ourselves rather than strengthening rigidity and self-criticism
- I can’t overestimate the importance of accepting ourselves exactly as we are right now, not as we wish we were or think we ought to be
- The first commitment allows us to slow down enough to become very intimate with how we feel when we’re pushed to the limit, very intimate with the urge to strike out or withdraw, become a bully or go numb.
- Neither repressing nor rejecting, we stay in the middle between the two extremes
- become a true friend to yourself just as you are, with both your laziness and your bravery. There is no step more important than this.
- contemplate what you do when you’re unhappy or dissatisfied and want to feel better
- Refraining but not repressing

### The Second Commitment - Committing to Take Care of One Another

- Awakening is not a process of building ourselves up but a process of letting go. It’s a process of relaxing in the middle
- we vow to move consciously into the pain of the world in order to help alleviate it.
- we cultivate the courage and flexibility to live with uncertainty—with the shaky, tender feeling of anxiety, of nothing to hold on to
- It is only to the degree that we become willing to face our own feelings that we can really help others
- It’s not that we won’t ever experience those feelings again
- the bravery to face the fact that we never know for sure what will really benefit and what, in fact, will only make matters worse.
- We probably learn more from our mistakes than from our successes
- That’s not to say there won’t be pain involved.
- fundamental uncertainty
- Life is full of opportunities for us to try again.
- Compassion is not a matter of pity or the strong helping the weak; it’s a relationship between equals, one of mutual support

### The Third Commitment - Committing to Embrace the World Just as It Is

- The feeling of nowhere to hide can be quite intense
- There is no way to get away from our experience, nowhere to go other than right where we are
- This is a commitment to not reject anything.
- You haven’t transcended the ordinary details of your life. Quite the opposite. You’ve finally contacted them 100 percent
- It’s only by fully touching our relative experience that we discover the fresh, timeless, ultimate nature of our world.
- The path to unshakable well-being lies in being completely present and open to all sights, all sounds, all thoughts—never withdrawing, never hiding, never needing to jazz them up or tone them down
at bottom, those opinions are merely our efforts to escape the underlying uneasiness of being human, the uneasiness of feeling like we can’t get ground under our feet.
- the fundamental ambiguity of being human
- when we do turn away, it’s based on being able to discriminate between turning away because we know we can’t handle something at the moment and turning away because we don’t want to feel what we’re feeling, don’t want to feel our vulnerability
- the sweetness of life and the harshness of life complement each other. Splendidness provides vision, and wretchedness grounds us
- It’s built into our DNA that when things are unpleasant and fearful, we look for the nearest exit
- most of us spend our entire life going from one promise of relief to another, never staying with the pain long enough to learn anything from it.
- One sign that you’ve already started charnel-ground practice, whether you realize it or not, is if you perk up when strong feelings come along and then, instead of trying to get rid of them, you move toward them and get curious
- If we’re doing this practice in earnest, the emotions and habitual patterns we’re working with can hit us with such force that it takes everything in us not to run.
- Our old habits are worthy opponents
- We need strong motivation to stick with it because the desire to escape is so compelling.
- When we can be present with an emotion without any distractions, we find out very quickly how insubstantial, how fleeting it is.
- We feel an emotion and it threatens to take us over, but if we stay open to it and look directly at it, it either disappears altogether or morphs into something else
- Only by completely, directly touching the reality of what’s going on inside us can we embrace the bitterness, the ruggedness, the fundamental groundlessness of life as readily as we embrace the sweetness
- The intensity of life nowadays is triggering high levels of anxiety and inner unrest, creating the ideal environment for charnel-ground practice

## Raw notes

- loosely based on traditional Buddhist material pertaining to what are called the Three Vows: the Pratimoksha Vow, the Bodhisattva Vow, and the Samaya Vow
- May this admittedly unconventional approach to a traditional subject be helpful and encouraging to all who read this book

### Introduction

#### 1 The Fundamental Ambiguity of Being Human

- Life is like stepping into a boat that is about to sail out to sea and sink. — SHUNRYU SUZUKI ROSHI
- **Our attempts to find lasting pleasure, lasting security, are at odds with the fact that we’re part of a dynamic system in which everything and everyone is in process.** So this is where we find ourselves: right in the middle of a dilemma
- Chögyam Trungpa, used to talk about **the fundamental anxiety of being human**
- Samaya Vow. It is **a commitment to see everything we encounter, good and bad, pleasant and painful, as a manifestation of awakened energy.**
- **Under the illusion that experiencing constant security and well-being is the ideal state, we do all sorts of things to try to achieve it.**
- That’s what it means to be in denial: you can’t hear anything that doesn’t fit into your fixed identity
- In Buddhism we call the notion of a fixed identity “ego clinging.” It’s how we try to put solid ground under our feet in an ever-shifting world.
- you feel as if your whole world is crumbling. But actually it’s your fixed identity that’s crumbling
- Once we have the fixed idea “this is me,” then we see everything as a threat or a promise
- **This discomfort, this sense of being triggered because things are not “right,” because we want them to last longer or to go away, is the felt experience, the visceral experience of the fundamental ambiguity of being human.**
- **Instead of trying to avoid the discomfort, you open yourself completely to it**
- If we can get in touch with the sensation as sensation and open ourselves to it without labelling it good or bad, then even when we feel the urge to draw back, we can stay present and move forward into the feeling.
- **Ego or fixed identity doesn’t just mean we have a fixed idea about ourselves. It also means that we have a fixed idea about everything we perceive**

#### 2 Life without the Story Line

- **instead of thinking of these feelings as bad, we could think of them as road signs or barometers that tell us we’re in touch with groundlessness**
- When you practice staying present, one thing you’ll quickly discover is how persistent the story line is
- It isn’t the current story line that’s the root of our pain; it’s our propensity to be bothered in the first place.
- **interrupting thoughts isn’t the same as repressing them**
- we don’t want to keep chasing after the thoughts and getting hooked by them
- **Interrupting thoughts is somewhere between clinging to them and pushing them away**
- **thoughts always come back. That’s the nature of mind**
- The practice is to train in not following the thoughts, not in **getting rid of thought altogether. That would be impossible**
- Chögyam Trungpa had an image for our tendency to obscure the openness of our being; he called it “putting makeup on space"
- when you revisit the memory of something distressing over and over, rehashing what happened and obsessing on the story line, it becomes part of your static identity
- **Continuing to recycle the old story line is a way of avoiding fundamental ambiguity**
- Be fully present. Feel your heart. And engage the next moment without an agenda.
- Underlying them all is the basic instruction to **make friends with yourself—to be honest with yourself and kind**

### The First Commitment - Committing to Not Cause Harm

#### 3 Laying the Foundation

- For us, however, taking a vow—making a commitment—allows us to not act reflexively when we have an urge
- **this commitment protects us from falling into or chasing after unnecessary cravings, unnecessary aggression, and unnecessary indifference**
- **The first commitment supports us in not escaping into our old patterns—in seeing very clearly that we’re about to exit, then making a conscious decision not to do it.**
- It liberates us by making us far more aware of what we’re feeling, so that whenever the urge to lie or slander or take something that isn’t given to us comes up—whenever we have the urge to act out our desires or aggression, or escape in any form—we refrain.
- **The first commitment is about refraining from speech and actions that are harmful to ourselves and others**
- **following the precepts gives us space to examine every nuance of the urge to express ourselves negatively and then, while fully acknowledging our feelings**, make the choice to not do anything that would cause harm.
- **It’s important, however, to refrain in a spirit of compassionate self-reflection.**
- when we’re not confounded by our emotions, we know what will help and what will hurt
- **good person with temporary, malleable habits that are causing you a lot of suffering**
- You rejoice when you’re able to acknowledge that you’re caught in an old pattern and when you catch yourself before you speak or act out
- **Each time we don’t refrain but speak or act out instead, we’re strengthening old habits. when we refrain, we’re allowing ourselves to feel the underlying uncertainty—that edgy, restless energy—without trying to escape**
- The first commitment works with the causes of suffering and brings about the cessation of suffering by **allowing us to see clearly what our escape routes are and enabling us not to take them**
- The Three Commitments aren’t moralistic—they have nothing to do with being a “good girl” or a “good boy.” They’re about opening ourselves to a vaster perspective and changing at the core
- At bottom, the commitment is very simple: **we’re either speaking or acting in order to escape, or we’re not.**
    - Note: SB: i am really starting to feel the No Escape thing in my practice
- It takes patience and an understanding of how we’re hurting ourselves not to continue taking the same old escape route of speaking or acting out.
- Precepts
    1. ON PROTECTING LIFE
    2. ON RESPECTING WHAT BELONGS TO OTHERS
        - The wording of the five precepts as set out below is loosely based on a version by the Vietnamese Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh.
    3. ON NOT HARMING OTHERS WITH OUR SEXUAL ENERGY
    4. ON MINDFUL SPEECH
    5. ON PROTECTING THE BODY AND MIND
- inner renunciation exercise:
    - Notice how you feel: What does it feel like in the body to have these cravings or aggressive urges?
    - Notice your thinking: What sort of thoughts do these feelings give birth to?
    - Notice your actions: How do you treat yourself and other people when you feel this way?
- practice of renouncing one thing:
    - For one day (or one day a week), refrain from something you habitually do to run away, to escape. Pick something concrete, such as overeating or excessive sleeping or overworking or spending too much time texting or checking e-mails. Make a commitment to yourself to gently and compassionately work with refraining from this habit for this one day. Really commit to it. **Do this with the intention that it will put you in touch with the underlying anxiety or uncertainty that you’ve been avoiding.** Do it and see what you discover.
- Instead of letting our regrets drag us down, we can use them to spur us on to not repeat harmful acts but to learn from them how to be wiser in the future. We are fundamentally good, not fundamentally flawed, and we can trust this.
- **Our situation is inescapable because of our interconnectedness with all things.** What makes the difference is our intention to not harm

#### 4 Be Fully Present, Feel Your Heart, and Leap

- it is a way to claim your courage, your kindness, your strength
- **let it be there just as it is, without labeling it good or bad, without telling yourself you should or shouldn’t be feeling that way**
- To reduce strain on your back, it’s best to make sure that your knees are not higher than your hips
- Chögyam Trungpa’s instruction was “open front, strong back.”
- **It’s important to have a kind attitude as we meditate, to train in making friends with ourselves rather than strengthening rigidity and self-criticism**
- Chögyam Trungpa taught instead to drop all labels that characterize thoughts as virtuous or unvirtuous and simply label thoughts “thinking.” That’s just what it is, thinking—no more, no less.
- **I can’t overestimate the importance of accepting ourselves exactly as we are right now, not as we wish we were or think we ought to be**

#### 5 Staying in the Middle

- **The first commitment allows us to slow down enough to become very intimate with how we feel when we’re pushed to the limit, very intimate with the urge to strike out or withdraw, become a bully or go numb.**
- As a way of working with our aggressive tendencies, Dzigar Kongtrül teaches the nonviolent practice of simmering. He says that rather than “boil in our aggression like a piece of meat cooking in a soup,” we simmer in it
- **Neither repressing nor rejecting, we stay in the middle between the two extremes**
- **become a true friend to yourself just as you are, with both your laziness and your bravery. There is no step more important than this.**
- **contemplate what you do when you’re unhappy or dissatisfied and want to feel better**
    - Then ask yourself: Does it work? Has it ever worked? Does it soothe the pain? Does it escalate the pain? If you’re really honest, you’ll come up with some pretty interesting observations.
- Whenever you realize you’re caught, right then, right on the spot, with kindness for yourself, you can acknowledge that you’re hooked. 
- we continually overreact when it’s hardly a life-or-death matter
- **Refraining but not repressing**
- The truth is that we’re always in some kind of in-between state, always in process. We never fully arrive

### The Second Commitment - Committing to Take Care of One Another

- **Awakening is not a process of building ourselves up but a process of letting go. It’s a process of relaxing in the middle**

#### 6 Beyond Our Comfort Zone

- COMPASSION IS THREATENING to the ego
- the uncomfortable territory of "life not on my terms"
- The second commitment builds on this foundation: **we vow to move consciously into the pain of the world in order to help alleviate it.**
- As warriors in training, **we cultivate the courage and flexibility to live with uncertainty—with the shaky, tender feeling of anxiety, of nothing to hold on to**—and to dedicate our lives to making ourselves available to every person, in every situation.
- **It is only to the degree that we become willing to face our own feelings that we can really help others**
- we make a commitment that for the rest of our lives, we’ll train in freeing ourselves from the tyranny of our own reactivity, our own survival mechanisms, our own propensities to be hooked.
- **It’s not that we won’t ever experience those feelings again**
- Another way we break the vow is through self-denigration—believing our own faults are intrinsic and impossible to remove
- the second commitment requires bravery—the bravery to do whatever we think will bring the greatest benefit, **the bravery to face the fact that we never know for sure what will really benefit and what, in fact, will only make matters worse.**
- showing up right on time to keep you honest. It’s the troublemakers in your life who cause you to see that you’ve shut down, that you’ve armoured yourself, that you’ve hidden your head in the sand
- an ongoing training in loving-kindness and compassion. One way to do this is to continually ask ourselves: How can I be of service?
- the warrior learns a lot by failing. **We probably learn more from our mistakes than from our successes**
- As warriors in training we do our best to hold the person in our heart without any hypocrisy.
- The aspiration of the warrior is to not close down ever—even when a personal relationship falters. **That’s not to say there won’t be pain involved.** The ending of a previously close relationship throws us right into the midst of **fundamental uncertainty**—and that definitely hurts. We’ve met our edge.
- we can’t make a single label stick. We can’t ever conclude definitively what someone is like, because the data is always changing

#### 7 Breathing In Pain, Breathing Out Relief

- tonglen - we breathe in the things we usually try to avoid, such as our sadness and anger, and we send out the things we usually cling to, such as our happiness and good health
- This is an exceedingly counterhabitual practice. It helps us overcome our fear of suffering and tap into the compassion that’s inherent in us all.
- Caring about people when they’re scared or sad or angry or arrogant can be a challenge; it confronts us with our own pain and fear, with the places where we’re stuck
- Instead of withdrawing into ourselves, we can use the grittiness, the harshness of the human condition as a way to rouse our natural ability to love, to care, to understand our interconnectedness
- Tonglen is especially useful when we get into a conflict with someone and feel our own pain and confusion rising
- We come to see pain as something that can transform us, not as something to escape at any cost.
- **Life is full of opportunities for us to try again.**
- **Compassion is not a matter of pity or the strong helping the weak; it’s a relationship between equals, one of mutual support**

#### 8 The Catalyst for Compassion

- Our challenge is to train in smiling at groundlessness, smiling at fear
- The way to work with it is to drop the story line and not pull back or buy into the idea, “This isn’t okay,” but instead to smile
- When you can smile at fear, there’s a shift: what you usually try to escape from becomes a vehicle for awakening you to your fundamental, primordial goodness, for awakening you to clear-mindedness, to a caring that holds nothing back.
- my pain will become the stepping-stone for understanding the pain of others. Rather than our own suffering making us more self-absorbed, it becomes the means by which we genuinely open to others’ suffering.
- the practice gives meaning to your suffering. Your attitude shifts.

### The Third Commitment - Committing to Embrace the World Just as It Is

#### 9 Nowhere to Hide

- **The feeling of nowhere to hide can be quite intense**
- **There is no way to get away from our experience, nowhere to go other than right where we are**
- **This is a commitment to not reject anything.**
- The attitude of the third commitment is that we live in a world that is intrinsically good, intrinsically awake, and our path is to realize this. Simply put, the practice at this stage is to turn toward your experience, all of it, and never turn away.
- **You haven’t transcended the ordinary details of your life. Quite the opposite. You’ve finally contacted them 100 percent**
- discovering basic goodness—discovering the awakeness, the is-ness, the nowness of things—doesn’t happen by transcending ordinary reality. It comes from appreciating simple experiences free of story line
- **It’s only by fully touching our relative experience that we discover the fresh, timeless, ultimate nature of our world.**
- Emptiness is not a void, a blank space where nothing is happening
- awakened energy manifesting, just as it is. It’s possible to see it without a story line.
- whatever occurs is the manifestation of emptiness, the manifestation of enlightened mind
- Whatever occurs in your mind
- **The path to unshakable well-being lies in being completely present and open to all sights, all sounds, all thoughts—never withdrawing, never hiding, never needing to jazz them up or tone them down**
- All the wars, all the hatred, all the ignorance in the world come out of being so invested in our opinions. And **at bottom, those opinions are merely our efforts to escape the underlying uneasiness of being human, the uneasiness of feeling like we can’t get ground under our feet.**
- **the fundamental ambiguity of being human**
- **when we do turn away, it’s based on being able to discriminate between turning away because we know we can’t handle something at the moment and turning away because we don’t want to feel what we’re feeling, don’t want to feel our vulnerability**

#### 10 Awakening in the Charnel Ground

- In this basic ground, many kinds of experiences coexist simultaneously. Uncertainty and unpredictability, impermanence and change, good times and hard times, sorrow and joy, loss and gain
- In the charnel ground, we meet both wretchedness and splendidness—the totality of our experience as human beings—and discover that we need both to be a genuine warrior
- wretchedness humbles us. It cuts through any sense of superiority or entitlement, through any delusions that comfort is somehow our birthright
- **the sweetness of life and the harshness of life complement each other. Splendidness provides vision, and wretchedness grounds us**
- We don’t awaken in some paradise where the circumstances are made to order. We awaken in the charnel ground.
- When you can see even the worst of hells as a place where you can awaken, your world will change dramatically. This isn’t how we usually relate to difficulties and discomfort, of course
- And if someone suggests that our suffering is a great opportunity for practice, we’re not likely to take it kindly. **It’s built into our DNA that when things are unpleasant and fearful, we look for the nearest exit**
- **most of us spend our entire life going from one promise of relief to another, never staying with the pain long enough to learn anything from it.**
- **One sign that you’ve already started charnel-ground practice, whether you realize it or not, is if you perk up when strong feelings come along and then, instead of trying to get rid of them, you move toward them and get curious**
- **If we’re doing this practice in earnest, the emotions and habitual patterns we’re working with can hit us with such force that it takes everything in us not to run.**
- **Our old habits are worthy opponents**
- **We need strong motivation to stick with it because the desire to escape is so compelling.**
- The instruction is: short moments again and again
- **When we can be present with an emotion without any distractions, we find out very quickly how insubstantial, how fleeting it is.** What seemed so threatening, so solid, so lasting, begins to dissolve, giving us an immediate experience of impermanence, as the feelings arise, dwell, and then pass away. **We feel an emotion and it threatens to take us over, but if we stay open to it and look directly at it, it either disappears altogether or morphs into something else**
- take your place joyfully, fearlessly, and confidently in the midst of the chaos and pain of your life.
- Allow yourself to soften and become tender, more approachable, and more inquisitive
- **Only by completely, directly touching the reality of what’s going on inside us can we embrace the bitterness, the ruggedness, the fundamental groundlessness of life as readily as we embrace the sweetness**
- **The intensity of life nowadays is triggering high levels of anxiety and inner unrest, creating the ideal environment for charnel-ground practice**

### Concluding Words

#### 11 We Are Needed

- The Three Commitments as I’ve presented them are a support for losing our fear of groundlessness, for becoming intimate with groundlessness, for making friends with the fundamental ambiguity of being human
- how does this shift happen? How can something we dislike so much become so soothing? The feeling itself doesn’t change. We just stop resisting it. We stop avoiding the unavoidable. We stop struggling against the dynamic, ever-changing quality of life and instead settle back and enjoy it.
