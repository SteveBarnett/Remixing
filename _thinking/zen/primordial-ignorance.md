Brief notes from [Primordial Ignorance on Hardcore Zen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np2Xw6RK1v8)

- Primordial Ignorance
    - Our perceptions are not reliable
    - Seeing is not believing!
- Intuition is important
    - But it can't be measured, quantified, it isn't objective

My additions

- Compare to thinking fast (and slow)
- Thinking fast can't be quantified, measured
- It's not so much that there are too many sources and data points
- More like it's infinite because everything is interconnected, interdependent
