The Sutra on the Heart of Realizing Wisdom Beyond Wisdom

> Avalokiteshvara, who helps all to awaken,<br>
moves in the deep course of<br>
realizing wisdom beyond wisdom,<br>
sees that all five streams of<br>
body, heart,and mind are without boundary,<br>
and frees all from anguish.<br>
O Shariputra [who listens to the teachings of the Buddha],<br>
form is not separate from boundlessness;<br>
boundlessness is not separate from form.<br>
Form is boundlessness; boundlessness is form.<br>
Feelings, perceptions, inclinations, and discernment are also like this.<br>
O Shariputra,<br>
boundlessness is the nature of all things.<br>
It neither arises nor perishes,<br>
neither stains nor purifies,<br>
neither increases nor decreases.<br>
Boundlessness is not limited by form,<br>
nor by feelings, perceptions, inclinations, or discernment.<br>
It is free of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind;<br>
free of sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and any object of mind;<br>
free of sensory realms, including the realm of the mind.<br>
It is free of ignorance and the end of ignorance.<br>
Boundlessness is free of old age and death,<br>
and free of the end of old age and death.<br>
It is free of suffering, arising, cessation, and path,<br>
and free of wisdom and attainment.<br>
 Being free of attainment, those who help all to awaken<br>
 abide in the realization of wisdom beyond wisdom<br>
and live with an unhindered mind.<br>
Without hindrance, the mind has no fear.<br>
Free from confusion, those who lead all to liberation<br>
embody profound serenity.<br>
All those in the past, present, and future,<br>
who realize wisdom beyond wisdom,<br>
manifest unsurpassable and thorough awakening.<br>
<br>
Know that realizing wisdom beyond wisdom<br>
is no other than this wondrous mantra,<br>
luminous, unequalled, and supreme.<br>
It relieves all suffering.<br>
It is genuine, not illusory.<br>
<br>
So set forth this mantra of realizing wisdom beyond wisdom.<br>
Set forth this mantra that says:<br>
<br>
GATÉ, GATÉ,PARAGATÉ, PARASAMGATÉ, BODHI! SVAHA!
