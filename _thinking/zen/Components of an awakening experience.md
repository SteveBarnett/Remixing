1. A deep experience of absence of self. No-self, emptiness. Can't answer "who are you?" because of lack of reference points. The unmanifest aspect of the Absolute.
2. A deep unity experience. Oneness, love. Not observing unity, a subjective, "I" witnessing it. An objective view, including us. The manifest aspect of the Absolute.
3. Recognition that this is who I truly am.

Can only really be confirmed (by a roshi) during, not after, a kensho experience. So, it needs to be quite deep, quite long-lasting.

Personality behaviours can still show up, but there's no sense of self. There are still preferences, but they're not rooted in a sense of self. Openness, freshness, don't-know-ing.

Loss of Personality View (as they call it in the Theravada tradition), not loss of personality. Understanding the core convictions and beliefs that we carry. This is one of the ways I behave, one of the choices I made: then we can work it.
