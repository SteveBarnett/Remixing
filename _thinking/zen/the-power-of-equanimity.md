## Raw highlights

- in our efforts to achieve some measure of equanimity, we may end up stuck in the tentative calm of denial or in the coldness of indifference. True equanimity is clear-eyed, undefended, compassionate, and inclusive
- Do we really want to feel equanimity when facing challenges, though? ... Not usually. We usually think our anger, anxiety, or fear are justified or necessary.
- When we’re exhausted by our emotions and need a break from them, it can be tempting to slip into denial of some kind. Unable to maintain equanimity while facing our problems, the only alternative often seems to be ignoring them as best we can.
- have we convinced ourselves that stable composure and even-mindedness will elude us until our problems are solved? If so, we are unlikely to experience much equanimity in our lifetimes.
- When we would like greater equanimity but imagine it to be dependent on indifference, we either dissociate from our life or create internal conflict with our own emotions. Both responses are a kind of inner violence.
- It’s like our emotional responses remain latent while we dissociate or suppress them, building up until we’re vulnerable and then bursting out all at once.
- Techniques for emotional regulation can help our lives feel more manageable and practice can help us let go of many responses that are based on our delusions and attachments, but still the emotional responses arise.
- some of our emotional responses end up feeling even more intractable the more we try to stop them ...
- Despite the excruciating pain he was experiencing, the Buddha was lying there with his heart and awareness wide open. He didn’t allow his difficulty to consume all his attention but maintained care and concern for all beings.
- this painful moment was not less worthy of mindfulness than a pleasant one
- Because he didn’t cling to a fixed idea about how the world should be, he was untroubled by the thought of its decline.
- Over time, our practice usually gives us more equanimity. It does this primarily by giving us a larger perspective.
- Our perspective broadens from the content of our minds to the space through which the content moves. Less identified with our emotional and mental experiences, we are often less upset by them.
- equanimity isn’t something we attain and keep. It’s a response to conditional turbulence in this moment, then this moment, then this moment. Like physical balance, it’s a response that manifests as we move and live.
- real equanimity is more profound than feeling confident everything is going to work out the way we want it to.
- Real, functional, in-the-moment equanimity isn’t rational. Instead, it’s a calm, centered way of being with the conditional turbulence we’re facing because that’s the wisest, most compassionate, and most effective way to be.
- In equanimity we reject nothing in the sense of trying to exclude it from our reality.
- Equanimity is showing up wholeheartedly in the messiness of life with fierce determination to do what’s needed and willingness not to know ahead of time what those needs might be or how we might respond.
- our emotional responses are part of the conditional turbulence we aim to face wholeheartedly.
