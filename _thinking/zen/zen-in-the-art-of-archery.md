- Become simultaneously the aimer and the aim, the hitter and the hit.
- Zen is immediate experience of the bottomless Ground of Being.
- The truth can't be comprehended intellectually.
- From absolute emptiness, allow a wondrous unfoldment of doing.
- **Don't overthink. Take yourself by surprise.**
- Let go of the separate. Let go of the need to separate.
- Feel the feeling of being breathed.
