### PROLOGUE PREPARING THE MENU

- You have to demonstrate the answer. You have to embody the answer.
- You have to manifest the answer in your life—in your everyday relationships, in the marketplace, at work, as well as in the temple or meditation hall.
- When we live our life fully, our life becomes what Zen Buddhists call “the supreme meal.”
- Zen is the realization of the oneness of life in all its aspects. It’s not just the pure or “spiritual” part of life: it’s the whole thing. It’s flowers, mountains, rivers, streams, and the inner city and homeless children on Forty-second Street.
- The position of the cook is one of the highest and most important in the Zen monastery.
- the first principle of the Zen cook is that we already have everything we need. If we look closely at our lives, we will find that we have all the ingredients we need to prepare the supreme meal. At every moment, we simply take the ingredients at hand and make the best meal we can. It doesn’t matter how much or how little we have. The Zen cook just looks at what is available and starts with that.
- according to the principles of the Zen cook, it always consists of five main “courses” or aspects of life. The first course involves spirituality; the second course is composed of study and learning; the third course deals with livelihood; the fourth course is made out of social action or change, and the last course consists of relationship and community.
- spirituality, helps us to realize the oneness of life and provides a still point at the center of all our activities.
- The second course is study or learning. Study provides sharpness and intelligence.
- Once we have established the clarity that comes from stillness and study, we can begin to see how to prepare the third course, which is livelihood. This is the course that sustains us in the physical world.
- The course of social action grows naturally out of the courses of spirituality and livelihood. Once we begin to take care of our own basic needs, we become more aware of the needs of the people around us. Recognizing the oneness of life, we naturally reach out to other people because we realize that we are not separate from them.
- The last course is the course of relationship and community. This is the course that brings all the seemingly separate parts of our life together into a harmonious whole. It’s the course that turns all the other courses—spirituality, livelihood, social action, and study—into a joyous feast.
- it is not a question of trying to arrange our life so that we prepare equal amounts of each course. We all need different ingredients, and different amounts, at different times in our lives.
- You need to look at your situation and find out how much of each ingredient is needed at any given moment.
- “the map is not the territory.” Or—as the Zen saying goes—“you can’t eat painted cakes.”

### THE FIRST COURSE: RECIPES FOR SPIRIT

- zazenkai—a Zen meditation sitting
- During meditation retreats, we ate our meals in the zendo—the meditation hall—so that even eating became part of our meditation.
- we are all hungry ghosts. It’s a metaphor for the part of us that’s unsatisfied. Because of our attachments and our conditioning, we miss the food and drink that’s right in front of us. In fact, the ingredients we need to make a meal that will satisfy us are all right here.
- a very human habit: we’re always looking for something beyond what is right in front of us.
- In Zen, a vow is not something we promise to do and then feel bad or guilty about if we don’t accomplish it. Rather, a vow is an intention to do something.
- a vow has a very practical function: it’s like a compass that shows us the direction to go in and that keeps us on course.
- if we want to see our vow manifest in the world,
- We have to add determination.
- The insight and equanimity that can come from spiritual practice should open our eyes to the problems of people around us and make us more effective.
- The Zen cook is always cooking other cooks who teach other cooks, and so on—infinitely. In this way, one person can have a tremendous effect.
- “Handle even a single leaf of a green in such a way that it manifests the body of the Buddha,” says Dogen. “This in turn allows the Buddha to manifest through the leaf.”
- The Zen cook follows the middle way. We have faith that the soup is coming along—but we still check now and then.
- For example, anger is considered a poison when it is self-motivated and self-centered. But take that attachment to the self out of anger, and the same emotion becomes the fierce energy of determination, which is a very positive force. Take the self-centered aspect out of greed, and it becomes the desire to help. Drop the self-orientation from ignorance, and it becomes a state of unknowing that allows new things to arise.
- The place we live, the leaves that fall, the haze around the moon, the traffic in the city streets, the corner market—all these are also our ingredients.
- the Zen cook knows that every aspect of life is an ingredient of the supreme meal.
- Dogen instructs us to take the ingredients we think are going to ruin our meal and figure out how to use them so that they improve it.
- Let’s say, for example, that someone is aggressive. But that energy might be just what’s needed for certain difficult jobs—dealing with recalcitrant bureaucrats, for example. Or perhaps someone is so preoccupied with details that they are unable to see the larger picture. You wouldn’t put that person on your five-year-planning committee. But they might be perfect as an accountant keeping track of daily receipts.
- If you can work with what you reject, it turns out that you’re working with yourself, with those parts of yourself that you’ve rejected.
- In every area, working with what you habitually reject is one of the best ways to facilitate growth and transformation.
- Most of the time, we worry about not having enough of any given ingredient. But the Zen cook is also aware of the danger of having too much. In fact, having too much can be one of the greatest traps of all.
- That’s not to say that we shouldn’t try to make things happen the way we want them to, or even the way we hope they will. But we can’t expect that they’ll happen that way.
- the Zen cook knows that we can’t prepare a meal if the kitchen is cluttered with last night’s dishes.
- So we always begin by cleaning. Even if the kitchen looks clean, we still have to clean it again each time we want to start a new meal.
- The cleaning process itself changes the cook as well as the surroundings and the people who come into those surroundings
- It doesn’t matter whether we think anything is dirty or not. We just clean.
- Just as we start cooking a meal by cleaning the kitchen, it’s helpful to start the day by cleaning our mind.
- Because we’re enlightened, we do zazen. Dogen says that zazen is a manifestation of the enlightened state. We practice and recognize everything we do as a manifestation of the enlightened state.
- Make the space aesthetically pleasing.
- Let your eyes remain half closed, half open, lightly resting on a spot on the floor approximately three feet in front of you. This will allow your eye muscles to relax while you keep an alert state of mind.
- Continue for a minimum of two and a maximum of thirty minutes.
- Our thoughts and emotions are like the ripples and waves that disturb the reflective surface of the lake, so that we can’t see the moon.
- it’s in the nature of form to exclude other forms. As soon as you create something, you create a boundary.
- the practice, the path, in trying to eliminate that boundary, then creates a new one.
- The emptiness of meditation does not denote a lack or absence of anything but is actually the state of openness that makes all things possible. It is like the space inside a cup or the space at the hub of the wheel. A full cup can’t receive anything, but an empty cup can receive all kinds of offerings.
- The Japanese sometimes describe ordinariness as orderliness. Order creates simplicity based on how things naturally are or work.
- Meditation allows things to fall in all the right places so that we can see clearly what comes up in the mind and let go of our judgments. We don’t say, “I won’t eat salt today, so I’m going to throw the salt out.” We just put the salt where it belongs.
- Our ordinary mind, with everything naturally settled in its right place, is actually the enlightened mind.
- We create the production process to fit the capabilities of our workforce.
- As our workers gained knowledge and expertise in simpler manual operations and as they learned better work habits, we upgraded our equipment. And our workers upgraded their skills.
- When things happen a certain way a number of times, we form the habit of expecting things to continue happening that way.
- But in actuality everything is always changing.
- we don’t have to forget the past. We only have to let go of our attachments to the past.
- I don’t have to be so attached to what happened in the past that it overwhelms what I think
- When we meditate, we begin to see the self-sufficiency of our own mind. We don’t need to add all sorts of things. We don’t need to build ourselves up.
- Dogen says, “Everything as it is is the enlightened way.”
- Problems will always arise, both in our individual life and in society.
- Some people might say that cleaning the dishes is solving the problem of dirty dishes. But it’s not, because you are going to eat another meal.
- The work of the Zen cook is cooking meals and cleaning dishes. It’s an endless process.
- The basic problem, actually, is how to get rid of the idea that we’re going to get rid of our problems.
- At the same time, we have to keep on working to improve our clarity. I don’t care if you are a Buddha. You can still improve your clarity.
- We clean things so that we can use them. We sweep the floor so we can walk on it.

### THE SECOND COURSE: RECIPES FOR LEARNING

- One of the best exemplars of Beginner’s Mind is a baby learning to walk.
- we don’t want to accept that the other confused and seemingly impure part of us is also the true self.
- in order to become whole, we need to go deeper and deeper into ourselves by reaching further and further into the things we fear.
- our concept of our self is nothing more than our concept of our self.
- once things are out in the open, we can either use them as ingredients or let go of our attachments to them so that they don’t control us.
- We lose a lot of fear when we feel there’s a group of people going through the same thing.
- We pay attention to that characteristic to see if it’s really so, or how it changes. And once again, we share it with others. In this way, we become more familiar with our habits and how they function. We see them as ingredients rather than as problems to be solved.
- all these likes and dislikes are very subjective.
- whatever judgment we make is a subjective one we’re making now, and that it could change.
- making and holding judgments can create problems.
- We need to practice both letting go and accepting.
- The things we are used to thinking of as faults tend to be the very things we can use to make delicious meals. But they’re tricky to use, like chili or hot pepper. We have to work with them carefully.
- Our faults contain a tremendous amount of energy. That energy can be used in a destructive or constructive way.
- When we think there is a place where everything will be perfect and there will be no problems, we are living in the future. But the future is an illusion.
- No matter how many techniques we learn, life will always be full of unexpected twists and turns.
- According to the way of the Zen cook, Beginner’s Mind has three basic ingredients. These three basic ingredients are doubt, faith, and determination.
- doubt or unknowing flows in accordance with the situation. It’s the state of surrender, of being open to what is. Only when we raise sufficient doubt and questioning can we go further.
- In Zen, we use meditation to help us see that the trap is really made out of our concepts.
- Even though the path is endless, we keep going.
- Even if you have doubt and faith, you need determination to take action.

### THE THIRD COURSE: RECIPES FOR LIVELIHOOD

- Pai-Chang simply said, “A day of no work is a day of no eating,”
- right livelihood is livelihood that minimizes suffering or damage.
- for the Zen cook, right livelihood can also be much more than that. Right livelihood is the course that sustains all aspects of our life.
- right livelihood has to include a spiritual dimension.
- Another aspect of right livelihood is that it also has to include study and learning
- right livelihood has to include social action of some kind.
- Authentic wisdom, on the other hand, cuts away our conditioning so that we can come up with our own solutions.
- Right livelihood is really at the heart of Zen, because of a “secret ingredient” that Zen Buddhists call “work-practice.”
- In samu or work-practice, we concentrate on our work. If we are cutting grass, we just cut the grass. If we are washing the dishes, we just wash the dishes. And if we are entering data into a computer, we just enter data into the computer.
- When we concentrate fully on our work in this way, there is no goal.
- “Yes, but is it Zen?” is a contemporary American version of a koan that appears in the classical Chinese text as “What is the Buddha?”
- Just because you have a little doesn’t mean you should do nothing. You can always do something.
- when we eliminate the gap between our expectations and what we’re doing, our energies all go into what we’re doing at the moment. We’re not wasting our energy on what we think we should be doing.
- The Zen cook avoids both these extremes by following the Middle Way of the Buddha.
- Too little reserve creates anxiety and insecurity. But too much can dull the edge that sharpens creativity.
- the best place to create a model is a place where there is an absence of models—where there are many problems but not many solutions being tried.

### THE FOURTH COURSE: RECIPES FOR SOCIAL CHANGE

- When we learn how to cook for ourselves, though, we find that our vision or understanding of the self grows and expands. The smell of food cooking and the warmth of the kitchen always invites people in.
- the Zen cook cooks for others because he or she sees that the separation between self and other is illusory.
- You have to ask people what they need and empower them to find their own solutions.
- we began to learn how difficult it is to effect real social change if you look at only one element.
- Much of what passes for help is nothing more than a quick fix.
- The pure lotus growing in muddy water is a metaphor for enlightenment. The lotus arises from all its impediments. It actually needs the impurity of the water for its nourishment. In the same way, in our own personal development, we can’t just work with what we like about ourselves. We have to work with our muddy water. We have to work with our problems and hang-ups because that’s where the action is.
- we did do our best to select people who wanted the meal we had to offer.

### THE FIFTH COURSE: RECIPES FOR COMMUNITY

- The Zen cook’s way of working with others is based on the vision of Indra’s net,
- it’s natural for most of us to begin “networking” with the people closest to our own interests and needs.
- But it is not a very effective overall strategy, because it leads to a narrowing instead of a widening of your network.
- it’s important to remember you’re still part of a bigger net.)
- It makes more sense, I think, to welcome competitors as guests and try to transform them into allies we can work with and learn from.
- we want other people to do what we’re doing. We want other people to copy us and replicate our models.
- We even published a cookbook, The Greyston Bakery Cookbook, with all the recipes for our unique gourmet specialties. Once we did that, we didn’t have to worry about anyone stealing our recipes!
- if everything is out in the open, if you have no secrets to steal, then you can concentrate on sharing information and creating cooperation within your company.
- It’s much more direct and effective to use your resources to create the best environment to accomplish your vision.
- the more constraints you add, the more realities you are dealing with. And the more realities you are dealing with, the more effective your business will be.
- we are trying to create an environment conducive to spiritual growth and transformation—not by advocating specific spiritual practices, but simply by creating an atmosphere where nonduality and the interdependency of life can be directly experienced.
- Because eating is not seen as a time for relaxation but as a continuation of meditation, the monks eat sitting on their meditation cushions in the meditation hall.
- The oryoki bowl is the container of just the right amount of food.
- Human beings always have an aesthetic dimension.
- The Japanese understand this very well. Every house or noodle shop, no matter how humble, contains a tokonomo—a niche to hang a painted scroll and exhibit a small flower arrangement. It’s a small thing, but it uplifts the spirit and adds dignity and grace to everyday life.
- we eliminate the separation that threatens life and makes killing possible in the first place,
- Even though it may not be possible, we should try to leave no trace of what we’ve done.
- If our enlightenment is genuine, it will express itself in the way we act in ordinary life.
- Leaving no trace is what Zen calls “nonduality.” Subject and object collapse. The distinction between the helper and those who are being helped disappears,
- Dogen doesn’t suggest that we cook our whole meal and then clean up at the end. He tells us that no trace should happen as we’re doing it—so that nobody knows what we’ve done. So we clean up while we’re cooking. We eliminate traces as we go.

### EPILOGUE: THE THIRD VOW

- Our approach on the street retreat was a little different. It was a retreat into the problems we were working with. The Zen cook learns more from the situation than from a study of the situation.
- When we experience things in this way, we begin to live in the unknown instead of living through our concepts.

PROLOGUE PREPARING THE MENU

You have to demonstrate the answer. You have to embody the answer.

You have to manifest the answer in your life—in your everyday relationships, in the marketplace, at work, as well as in the temple or meditation hall.

When we live our life fully, our life becomes what Zen Buddhists call “the supreme meal.”

Zen is the realization of the oneness of life in all its aspects. It’s not just the pure or “spiritual” part of life: it’s the whole thing. It’s flowers, mountains, rivers, streams, and the inner city and homeless children on Forty-second Street.

The position of the cook is one of the highest and most important in the Zen monastery.

the first principle of the Zen cook is that we already have everything we need. If we look closely at our lives, we will find that we have all the ingredients we need to prepare the supreme meal. At every moment, we simply take the ingredients at hand and make the best meal we can. It doesn’t matter how much or how little we have. The Zen cook just looks at what is available and starts with that.

according to the principles of the Zen cook, it always consists of five main “courses” or aspects of life. The first course involves spirituality; the second course is composed of study and learning; the third course deals with livelihood; the fourth course is made out of social action or change, and the last course consists of relationship and community.

spirituality, helps us to realize the oneness of life and provides a still point at the center of all our activities.

The second course is study or learning. Study provides sharpness and intelligence.

Once we have established the clarity that comes from stillness and study, we can begin to see how to prepare the third course, which is livelihood. This is the course that sustains us in the physical world.

The course of social action grows naturally out of the courses of spirituality and livelihood. Once we begin to take care of our own basic needs, we become more aware of the needs of the people around us. Recognizing the oneness of life, we naturally reach out to other people because we realize that we are not separate from them.

The last course is the course of relationship and community. This is the course that brings all the seemingly separate parts of our life together into a harmonious whole. It’s the course that turns all the other courses—spirituality, livelihood, social action, and study—into a joyous feast.

it is not a question of trying to arrange our life so that we prepare equal amounts of each course. We all need different ingredients, and different amounts, at different times in our lives.

You need to look at your situation and find out how much of each ingredient is needed at any given moment.

PAINTED CAKES ARE REAL, TOO

“the map is not the territory.” Or—as the Zen saying goes—“you can’t eat painted cakes.”

THE FIRST COURSE RECIPES FOR SPIRIT

1 THE MAKING OF A ZEN COOK

zazenkai—a Zen meditation sitting

HUNGRY GHOSTS

During meditation retreats, we ate our meals in the zendo—the meditation hall—so that even eating became part of our meditation.

we are all hungry ghosts. It’s a metaphor for the part of us that’s unsatisfied. Because of our attachments and our conditioning, we miss the food and drink that’s right in front of us. In fact, the ingredients we need to make a meal that will satisfy us are all right here.

a very human habit: we’re always looking for something beyond what is right in front of us.

In Zen, a vow is not something we promise to do and then feel bad or guilty about if we don’t accomplish it. Rather, a vow is an intention to do something.

a vow has a very practical function: it’s like a compass that shows us the direction to go in and that keeps us on course.

if we want to see our vow manifest in the world,

We have to add determination.

COOKING COOKS

The insight and equanimity that can come from spiritual practice should open our eyes to the problems of people around us and make us more effective.

The Zen cook is always cooking other cooks who teach other cooks, and so on—infinitely. In this way, one person can have a tremendous effect.

2 HOW TO COOK

“Handle even a single leaf of a green in such a way that it manifests the body of the Buddha,” says Dogen. “This in turn allows the Buddha to manifest through the leaf.”

TRANSFORMATION

The Zen cook follows the middle way. We have faith that the soup is coming along—but we still check now and then.

For example, anger is considered a poison when it is self-motivated and self-centered. But take that attachment to the self out of anger, and the same emotion becomes the fierce energy of determination, which is a very positive force. Take the self-centered aspect out of greed, and it becomes the desire to help. Drop the self-orientation from ignorance, and it becomes a state of unknowing that allows new things to arise.

INGREDIENTS

The place we live, the leaves that fall, the haze around the moon, the traffic in the city streets, the corner market—all these are also our ingredients.

the Zen cook knows that every aspect of life is an ingredient of the supreme meal.

USE EVERYTHING

Dogen instructs us to take the ingredients we think are going to ruin our meal and figure out how to use them so that they improve it.

Let’s say, for example, that someone is aggressive. But that energy might be just what’s needed for certain difficult jobs—dealing with recalcitrant bureaucrats, for example. Or perhaps someone is so preoccupied with details that they are unable to see the larger picture. You wouldn’t put that person on your five-year-planning committee. But they might be perfect as an accountant keeping track of daily receipts.

NONREJECTION

If you can work with what you reject, it turns out that you’re working with yourself, with those parts of yourself that you’ve rejected.

In every area, working with what you habitually reject is one of the best ways to facilitate growth and transformation.

TOO MUCH ZEN

Most of the time, we worry about not having enough of any given ingredient. But the Zen cook is also aware of the danger of having too much. In fact, having too much can be one of the greatest traps of all.

SPICE

That’s not to say that we shouldn’t try to make things happen the way we want them to, or even the way we hope they will. But we can’t expect that they’ll happen that way.

3 CLEANING KITCHEN IS CLEANING MIND

the Zen cook knows that we can’t prepare a meal if the kitchen is cluttered with last night’s dishes.

So we always begin by cleaning. Even if the kitchen looks clean, we still have to clean it again each time we want to start a new meal.

The cleaning process itself changes the cook as well as the surroundings and the people who come into those surroundings

It doesn’t matter whether we think anything is dirty or not. We just clean.

CLEANING THE MIND

Just as we start cooking a meal by cleaning the kitchen, it’s helpful to start the day by cleaning our mind.

Because we’re enlightened, we do zazen. Dogen says that zazen is a manifestation of the enlightened state. We practice and recognize everything we do as a manifestation of the enlightened state.

Make the space aesthetically pleasing.

Let your eyes remain half closed, half open, lightly resting on a spot on the floor approximately three feet in front of you. This will allow your eye muscles to relax while you keep an alert state of mind.

Continue for a minimum of two and a maximum of thirty minutes.

CLEARING THE LAKE

Our thoughts and emotions are like the ripples and waves that disturb the reflective surface of the lake, so that we can’t see the moon.

A PLACE FOR EVERYBODY

it’s in the nature of form to exclude other forms. As soon as you create something, you create a boundary.

the practice, the path, in trying to eliminate that boundary, then creates a new one.

START BY DOING NOTHING

The emptiness of meditation does not denote a lack or absence of anything but is actually the state of openness that makes all things possible. It is like the space inside a cup or the space at the hub of the wheel. A full cup can’t receive anything, but an empty cup can receive all kinds of offerings.

A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING

The Japanese sometimes describe ordinariness as orderliness. Order creates simplicity based on how things naturally are or work.

Meditation allows things to fall in all the right places so that we can see clearly what comes up in the mind and let go of our judgments. We don’t say, “I won’t eat salt today, so I’m going to throw the salt out.” We just put the salt where it belongs.

Our ordinary mind, with everything naturally settled in its right place, is actually the enlightened mind.

PUT PEOPLE IN THE RIGHT PLACE

We create the production process to fit the capabilities of our workforce.

As our workers gained knowledge and expertise in simpler manual operations and as they learned better work habits, we upgraded our equipment. And our workers upgraded their skills.

THE CLUTTER OF CONDITIONING

When things happen a certain way a number of times, we form the habit of expecting things to continue happening that way.

But in actuality everything is always changing.

we don’t have to forget the past. We only have to let go of our attachments to the past.

I don’t have to be so attached to what happened in the past that it overwhelms what I think

NOTHING IS MISSING

When we meditate, we begin to see the self-sufficiency of our own mind. We don’t need to add all sorts of things. We don’t need to build ourselves up.

Dogen says, “Everything as it is is the enlightened way.”

ZEN WON’T SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS

Problems will always arise, both in our individual life and in society.

Some people might say that cleaning the dishes is solving the problem of dirty dishes. But it’s not, because you are going to eat another meal.

The work of the Zen cook is cooking meals and cleaning dishes. It’s an endless process.

The basic problem, actually, is how to get rid of the idea that we’re going to get rid of our problems.

DON’T WAIT UNTIL YOU’RE ENLIGHTENED

At the same time, we have to keep on working to improve our clarity. I don’t care if you are a Buddha. You can still improve your clarity.

DON’T CLEAN JUST TO CLEAN

We clean things so that we can use them. We sweep the floor so we can walk on it.

THE SECOND COURSE RECIPES FOR LEARNING

4 BEGINNER’S MIND

One of the best exemplars of Beginner’s Mind is a baby learning to walk.

LEARN FROM FEAR

we don’t want to accept that the other confused and seemingly impure part of us is also the true self.

in order to become whole, we need to go deeper and deeper into ourselves by reaching further and further into the things we fear.

TAKING OUR OWN INVENTORY

our concept of our self is nothing more than our concept of our self.

once things are out in the open, we can either use them as ingredients or let go of our attachments to them so that they don’t control us.

We lose a lot of fear when we feel there’s a group of people going through the same thing.

FROM CHARACTERISTICS TO INGREDIENTS

We pay attention to that characteristic to see if it’s really so, or how it changes. And once again, we share it with others. In this way, we become more familiar with our habits and how they function. We see them as ingredients rather than as problems to be solved.

LET GO AND ACCEPT

all these likes and dislikes are very subjective.

whatever judgment we make is a subjective one we’re making now, and that it could change.

making and holding judgments can create problems.

We need to practice both letting go and accepting.

OUR FAULTS ARE OUR BEST INGREDIENTS

The things we are used to thinking of as faults tend to be the very things we can use to make delicious meals. But they’re tricky to use, like chili or hot pepper. We have to work with them carefully.

Our faults contain a tremendous amount of energy. That energy can be used in a destructive or constructive way.

PROBLEMS-SOLVING

When we think there is a place where everything will be perfect and there will be no problems, we are living in the future. But the future is an illusion.

No matter how many techniques we learn, life will always be full of unexpected twists and turns.

5 BASIC INGREDIENTS

According to the way of the Zen cook, Beginner’s Mind has three basic ingredients. These three basic ingredients are doubt, faith, and determination.

doubt or unknowing flows in accordance with the situation. It’s the state of surrender, of being open to what is. Only when we raise sufficient doubt and questioning can we go further.

In Zen, we use meditation to help us see that the trap is really made out of our concepts.

Even though the path is endless, we keep going.

Even if you have doubt and faith, you need determination to take action.

THE THIRD COURSE RECIPES FOR LIVELIHOOD

6 GREYSTON BAKERY

Pai-Chang simply said, “A day of no work is a day of no eating,”

THE MAIN COURSE

THE LIVELIHOOD COURSE

right livelihood is livelihood that minimizes suffering or damage.

for the Zen cook, right livelihood can also be much more than that. Right livelihood is the course that sustains all aspects of our life.

right livelihood has to include a spiritual dimension.

Another aspect of right livelihood is that it also has to include study and learning

right livelihood has to include social action of some kind.

FINDING THE RIGHT LIVELIHOOD

WHO YOU KNOW

WHAT YOU KNOW

SEE FOR YOURSELF

DETAILS ARE ALL THERE ARE

PAY ATTENTION

KNOW YOUR COSTS

WHERE DID THE MONEY COME FROM?

BREAD OR CAKE

BE WILLING TO EXPERIMENT

COOK FROM SCRATCH

Authentic wisdom, on the other hand, cuts away our conditioning so that we can come up with our own solutions.

USE LOCAL INGREDIENTS

HOW TO SELL

KNOW WHERE YOUR INGREDIENTS
COME FROM

OUR SECRET INGREDIENT

Right livelihood is really at the heart of Zen, because of a “secret ingredient” that Zen Buddhists call “work-practice.”

In samu or work-practice, we concentrate on our work. If we are cutting grass, we just cut the grass. If we are washing the dishes, we just wash the dishes. And if we are entering data into a computer, we just enter data into the computer.

When we concentrate fully on our work in this way, there is no goal.

OUR MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIENT

YES, BUT IS IT ZEN?

“Yes, but is it Zen?” is a contemporary American version of a koan that appears in the classical Chinese text as “What is the Buddha?”

7 TIME AND MONEY

Just because you have a little doesn’t mean you should do nothing. You can always do something.

NOT ENOUGH TIME

when we eliminate the gap between our expectations and what we’re doing, our energies all go into what we’re doing at the moment. We’re not wasting our energy on what we think we should be doing.

NOT ENOUGH MONEY

The Zen cook avoids both these extremes by following the Middle Way of the Buddha.

Too little reserve creates anxiety and insecurity. But too much can dull the edge that sharpens creativity.

JUST ENOUGH

A LITTLE IS OFTEN ENOUGH

the best place to create a model is a place where there is an absence of models—where there are many problems but not many solutions being tried.

8 WHO ARE YOU COOKING FOR?

When we learn how to cook for ourselves, though, we find that our vision or understanding of the self grows and expands. The smell of food cooking and the warmth of the kitchen always invites people in.

SELF AND OTHER

the Zen cook cooks for others because he or she sees that the separation between self and other is illusory.

You have to ask people what they need and empower them to find their own solutions.

Much of what passes for help is nothing more than a quick fix.

THE LOTUS IN THE MUDDY WATER

The pure lotus growing in muddy water is a metaphor for enlightenment. The lotus arises from all its impediments. It actually needs the impurity of the water for its nourishment. In the same way, in our own personal development, we can’t just work with what we like about ourselves. We have to work with our muddy water. We have to work with our problems and hang-ups because that’s where the action is.

12 THE MEAL OF SELF-SUFFICIENCY

we did do our best to select people who wanted the meal we had to offer.

13 INDRA’S NETWORKING

The Zen cook’s way of working with others is based on the vision of Indra’s net,

it’s natural for most of us to begin “networking” with the people closest to our own interests and needs.

But it is not a very effective overall strategy, because it leads to a narrowing instead of a widening of your network.

it’s important to remember you’re still part of a bigger net.)

DON’T WORRY ABOUT COMPETITION

It makes more sense, I think, to welcome competitors as guests and try to transform them into allies we can work with and learn from.

we want other people to do what we’re doing. We want other people to copy us and replicate our models.

We even published a cookbook, The Greyston Bakery Cookbook, with all the recipes for our unique gourmet specialties. Once we did that, we didn’t have to worry about anyone stealing our recipes!

if everything is out in the open, if you have no secrets to steal, then you can concentrate on sharing information and creating cooperation within your company.

NETWORKING IN

14 SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS CONFECTIONERS

It’s much more direct and effective to use your resources to create the best environment to accomplish your vision.

15 TO PROFIT OR NOT TO PROFIT

THE PAYOFF

the more constraints you add, the more realities you are dealing with. And the more realities you are dealing with, the more effective your business will be.

TO PROFIT OR NOT TO PROFIT

SELF-DIRECTED MANAGEMENT TEAMS

DEFINE YOUR BOTTOM LINE

COOKING A BUSINESS

we are trying to create an environment conducive to spiritual growth and transformation—not by advocating specific spiritual practices, but simply by creating an atmosphere where nonduality and the interdependency of life can be directly experienced.

FOOD FOR THE BUDDHAS

Because eating is not seen as a time for relaxation but as a continuation of meditation, the monks eat sitting on their meditation cushions in the meditation hall.

The oryoki bowl is the container of just the right amount of food.

MAKE IT LOOK GOOD

Human beings always have an aesthetic dimension.

The Japanese understand this very well. Every house or noodle shop, no matter how humble, contains a tokonomo—a niche to hang a painted scroll and exhibit a small flower arrangement. It’s a small thing, but it uplifts the spirit and adds dignity and grace to everyday life.

FROM HELL TO HEAVEN

OFFERING GOES TWO WAYS

17 HOW TO EAT

LIFE AND DEATH

we eliminate the separation that threatens life and makes killing possible in the first place,

LEAVE A LITTLE SPACE

DAILY BREAD

18 CLEARING THE TABLE

Even though it may not be possible, we should try to leave no trace of what we’ve done.

If our enlightenment is genuine, it will express itself in the way we act in ordinary life.

Leaving no trace is what Zen calls “nonduality.” Subject and object collapse. The distinction between the helper and those who are being helped disappears,

Dogen doesn’t suggest that we cook our whole meal and then clean up at the end. He tells us that no trace should happen as we’re doing it—so that nobody knows what we’ve done. So we clean up while we’re cooking. We eliminate traces as we go.

19 STARTING AGAIN

EPILOGUE: THE THIRD VOW

Our approach on the street retreat was a little different. It was a retreat into the problems we were working with. The Zen cook learns more from the situation than from a study of the situation.

When we experience things in this way, we begin to live in the unknown instead of living through our concepts.
