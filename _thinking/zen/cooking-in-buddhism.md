we repeat cooking and eating everyday, and those activities can become so trivial to us. That is why only a few people pay close attention to the true meaning of preparing meals and eating.

## The Verse of Five Contemplations

- First, we reflect on the effort that brought us this food, and consider how it comes to us.
- Second, we reflect on our virtue and practice, and whether we are worthy of this offering.
- Third, we regard greed as the obstacle to freedom of mind.
- Fourth, we regard this meal as medicine to sustain our life.
- Fifth, for the sake of enlightenment we now receive this food.
