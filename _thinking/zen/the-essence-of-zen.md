## Notes

- What lies beyond our habitual way of seeing things? What is the essence of things? What is our true nature?
- **All things are impermanent**
    - The desire for things to stay fixed, permanent, is a source of suffering
    - There can't be a fixed, permanent, self
- **All things are interdependent**
    - The more we pay attention to the world, the less separate we feel from it
    - **Humans are part of nature** rather than its stewards or overlords
- **The non-duality of samsara and nirvana**
    - The everyday world and the world of enlightenment are not separate
- **Insight and wisdom are lived experiences that cannot be encapsulated in words**
    - Insight and wisdom are to be shared for the benefit of all sentient beings (the bodhisattva ideal)
- Momentary flashes of enlightenment cannot be predicted, let alone forced
    - **Practice, zazen, lays the ground for flashes**
- Dogen realised that **Buddha-nature is something that must be lived moment to moment**
    - Meditation is the best way to do this
- **The ethics of Zen are contextual rather than absolute**
- Spiritual teaching can be misused
    - A complete religious life also involves rational reflection and the exercise of moral judgement
- “Zen aesthetic”: simplicity, refinement, spontaneity, naturalness
- Beginner’s mind or everyday mind: innocence and spontaneity, but/and infused with experience and insight

## Gathered highlights

- All existence is anicca, impermanent, so the desire for things to stay the same is a source of suffering.
- Things are constantly changing, there can be no eternal, unchanging Self.
- Existence is characterised by sunyata, emptiness. This means related to everything else, rather than void.
- All things are interdependent.
- The non-duality of samsara and nirvana - the everyday world and the world of enlightenment are not separate.
- The bodhisattva ideal - wisdom and insight are to be shared for the benefit of all sentient beings.
- Directing pointing to the mind of humankind.
... insight and wisdom are lived experiences that cannot be encapsulated in words.
Satori, momentary flashes of enlightenment, cannot be predicted, let alone forced, but the ground for them by long periods of zazen (and koan) practice.
- Dogen realised that Buddha-nature is not something we own like a suit, but must be lived from moment to moment, and that meditation is the best way to do this.
- Spiritual teaching can be misused. A complete religious life also involves rational reflection and the exercise of moral judgement.
- However many precepts one has vowed to uphold, the ethics of Zen are contextual rather than absolute. The Mahayana tradition calls with upaya, "skilful means".
- What lies beyond our habitual way of seeing things? What is the essence of things? What is your true nature?
- "Zen aesthetic" - characterised by simplicity, refinement, spontaneity, and a love of natural forms, textures, and lines.
- No-mind is also "beginner's mind" or "everyday mind": at the end of their arduous training, the master returns to the innocence and spontaneity of a child - and yet is infused with experience and insight.
- Develop a simple ritual to end zazen, like a simple gassho (hands together and upright at heart level, short bow forward) or ringing a bell, then get up and get on with other things without mulling over zazen.
- Humans are part of nature, "plain members of this biotic community", rather than its stewards or overlords.
- The more we pay attention to the world around us, the less separate we feel from it.
- There is no essence of Zen. That is the essence of Zen.

## Raw highlights

### The Buddhist heritage

- The idea of an eternal, unchanging Self, the rigidity of the cast system, and the belief that liberation takes many lifetimes were all rejected by Buddha, who sought to create a spiritual path that avoids superstition, dogmatism, and extreme practices.
- Several important beliefs underlie the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path
    - **All existence is anicca, impermanent, so the desire for things to stay the same is a source of suffering.**
    - Anatman: **because things are constantly changing, there can be no eternal, unchanging Self** or Atman.
    - Instead, **existence is characterised by sunyata, emptiness. This means related to everything else, rather than void.**
    - Attaining nirvana, enlightenment, depends not on the worship of a god or the performance of particular rituals but on individual effort.
- One other Ch'an master had a lasting influence on Zen. Pai-chang developed a monastic rule based on a new precept: "a day without work is a day without food." ... enlightenment is not a matter only for the meditation hall, but can be found in everyday life.

### Japanese Zen

Today about 2.5 million Rinzai and 7 million Soto Zen followers can be found in Japan.

Zen inherits the central teachings of Mahayana Buddhism:

- Sunyata - nothing has a fixed and separate identity, so **all things are interdependent**.
- All beings possess Buddha-nature - that is, the ability to become enlightened.
- **The non-duality of samsara and nirvana - the everyday world and the world of enlightenment are not separate.**
- **The bodhisattva ideal - wisdom and insight are to be shared for the benefit of all sentient beings.**

However, Zen also claims to be unique, featuring:

- A special transmission outside the scriptures.
- No dependence on words and letters.
- **Directing pointing to the mind of humankind.**
- Seeing into one's nature and the attainment of Buddhahood.

... **insight and wisdom are lived experiences that cannot be encapsulated in words.**

**Satori, momentary flashes of enlightenment, cannot be predicted, let alone forced, but the ground for them by long periods of zazen (and koan) practice.**

> Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.

**Dogen realised that Buddha-nature is not something we own like a suit, but must be lived from moment to moment, and that meditation is the best way to do this.**

The association of Zen with bushido shows that **spiritual teaching can be misused.** Rather than being a reason to reject Zen, it might remind us that **a complete religious life also involves rational reflection and the exercise of moral judgement.**

**However many precepts one has vowed to uphold, the ethics of Zen are contextual rather than absolute. The Mahayana tradition calls with upaya, "skilful means".**

Koans are intended to use the mind against the mind: to break through the normal ways of understanding to a deeper, more intuitive awareness.

**What lies beyond our habitual way of seeing things? What is the essence of things? What is your true nature?**

### Zen in the arts

- **"Zen aesthetic" - characterised by simplicity, refinement, spontaneity, and a love of natural forms, textures, and lines.**
- **No-mind is also "beginner's mind" or "everyday mind": at the end of their arduous training, the master returns to the innocence and spontaneity of a child - and yet is infused with experience and insight.**
- Shibui refers to something subtle and understated that manifests itself when all the elements come together in a disciplined but natural and understated way.

### Zen in the West

Robert Wilson: What is Zen?
Alan Watts: [Soft chuckling]
Robert Wilson: Would you care to enlarge on that?
Alan Watts: [Loud laughing]

It's less important to understand how our suffering came about that to do what we can in the present to end it.

### Living the Zen life

- If you keep dozing off, maybe you need rest more than meditation!
- **Develop a simple ritual to end zazen, like a simple gassho (hands together and upright at heart level, short bow forward) or ringing a bell, then get up and get on with other things without mulling over zazen.**
- Through the writings of Robert Aitken and Gary Snyder, Zen has been influential is the Deep Ecology movement, which is founded on the idea that **humans are part of nature, "plain members of this biotic community", rather than its stewards or overlords.** This could be a purely intellectual or moralistic attitude, except that **the more we pay attention to the world around us, the less separate we feel from it.**

**There is no essence of Zen. That is the essence of Zen.**
