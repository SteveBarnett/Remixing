## Raw Notes

### Introduction The Transformative Power Of Death

- In the light of dying, it’s easy to distinguish between the tendencies that lead us toward wholeness, and those that incline us toward separation and suffering.
- interconnectedness.
- Fixed views and habits silence our minds and incline us toward life on automatic pilot. Questions open our minds and express the dynamism of being human.
- Through the application of these skillful means, I learned not to be incapacitated by the suffering of my earlier life, but rather to allow it to form the ground of compassion within me. show up as a calm and loving presence.
- The Five Invitations:
    1. Don’t wait.
    2. Welcome everything, push away nothing.
    3. Bring your whole self to the experience.
    4. Find a place of rest in the middle of things.
    5. Cultivate don’t know mind.

### The First Invitation Don't Wait

- Embracing the truth that all things inevitably must end encourages us not to wait in order to begin living each moment in a manner that is deeply engaged.
- Don’t wait is a pathway to fulfillment and an antidote to regret.

#### 1 The Doorway To Possibility

- The great Korean Zen master Seung Sahn was famous for saying, “Soon dead.” A wry wake-up call.
- constant change, impermanence, is not later. It is right now.
- Our work is to move this understanding from our intellect and to nestle it deep within our hearts.
- In Buddhism, impermanence is often referred to as the “Law of Change and Becoming.” These two correlated principles provide balance and harmony. Just as there is constant “dissolving,” there is also constant “becoming.”

#### 2 At Once Here And Disappearing

- It’s natural for us to fall apart in the face of loss. No need to stop it. Often our old coping mechanisms simply don’t work in this new context. However, finding our ground or recalling what has been most meaningful can help us stay present with what we are experiencing.
- Dying, in many cases, does not happen all of a sudden. It is a gradual process of withdrawing from life in form.
- Over the years, I have found that what we can experience or know directly may be much more important than our ability to explain or measure it.
- we push below the surface of our awareness what we fear will threaten our survival, and we present to the world whatever we believe will get us what we need.
- Over the years, patterns become deeply ingrained, forming and sustaining our self-image, which in turn gives birth to a sense of personal identity.
- Once recognized, we can allow the identification to be without pushing it away. No need to fight it.
- Gradually, it will dissolve because it, too, is impermanent.
- Taking ourselves too seriously is the cause of much suffering. We tell ourselves that we are in charge: in reality, we are quite helpless, subject to the events taking place around us.

#### 3 The Maturation Of Hope

- Attaching our happiness to a specific outcome causes us all sorts of suffering. To manage that distress, we attempt to control everything that is happening around us.
- The hope is in the potential for our awakened response, not in things turning out a particular way.
- The “good death” is a myth. Dying is messy.
- In my experience, the romantic expectation of a good death places an immense and unnecessary burden on the dying.
- What if instead, we cultivated a non-judgmental attention and commitment to being with the truth of whatever is present?
- The difference between don’t wait and non-waiting is like the difference between detachment and non-attachment.
- Non-waiting is not patience. Patience implies expectation, waiting for the next moment, just doing it in a calmer way. The experience of non-waiting is more like continuous contact with reality.
- In living, as in dying, when we hold hope apart from expectation, independent of attachment to outcome, we develop a wise connection with reality.
- We engage in the journey instead of waiting to arrive at our destination.

#### 4 The Heart Of The Matter

- Listening without judgment is probably the simplest, most profound way to connect. It is an act of love.
- Loving and letting go are inseparable. You can’t love and cling at the same time. Too often we mistake attachment for love.
- Forgiveness allows us to let go of pain not by sugarcoating it with positive thoughts, but by allowing our experience to come forward so that we can touch our pain with mercy.
- We don’t have to let old hurts continue to define who we are in the here and now. We can let the past dissolve. We can leave it behind.
- Forgiveness isn’t about squelching any of these emotions. It is about facing them with kindness, paying close attention to what is getting in the way of our letting go.
- We might extend our forgiveness to others or ask for forgiveness from them, but primarily it is an act of self-interest, not about changing the other person.
- When we forgive, we give ourselves the medicine that is most helpful, touching ourselves with radical self-acceptance.

### The Second Invitation Welcome Everything, Push Away Nothing

- When we are open and receptive, we have options.
- With welcoming comes an ability to meet and work with both pleasant and unpleasant circumstances.

#### 5 As Is

- In the Buddhist way of thinking, openness is one of the key characteristics of an awake and curious mind. It does not determine reality, it discovers it.
- Openness doesn’t reject or get attached to a particular experience or view. It is a spacious, undefended, non-biased allowing.
- welcoming the bad times and the good times as equally valid experiences.
- I could not change the situation. If I railed against it, I would only cause myself more suffering.
- Acceptance is not resignation. It is an opening to possibility. And openness is the basis for a skillful response to life.

#### 6 Turn Toward Your Suffering

- we have become masters of distraction. To a great extent, this is our primary human practice.
- When we allow the experience—creating space and acceptance for it—we find that our suffering is not a static, monolithic thing, but rather it is composed of many elements, including our attitudes toward dukkha, which is sometimes translated as “anguish” or more simply as “unsatisfactoriness” or even “stress.”
- The familiar adage says, “Pain is inevitable; suffering is optional.”
- Ajahn Chah: when I understand that this glass is already broken, every minute with it is precious.
- when we bear witness to our own suffering, we stop separating ourselves from it. We realize that it is an integral part of the human condition;

#### Love Heals

- Love provides us with a way of approaching life that softens the identification that keeps unskillful habits from hardening into character.
- Attachment likes to impersonate love.
- Love is focused on generosity; attachment is obsessed with getting needs met.
- Love is the motivation that enables us to move toward fear—not in order to conquer it, but in order to include it so that we might learn from it.

### The Third Invitation Bring Your Whole Self To The Experience

- more than once I have found an “undesirable” aspect of myself, one about which I previously had felt ashamed and kept tucked away, to be the very quality that allowed me to meet another person’s suffering with compassion instead of fear or pity.
- It is not our expertise, but rather the wisdom gained from our own suffering, vulnerability, and healing that enables us to be of real assistance to others.
- Wholeness does not mean perfection. It means no part left out.

#### 8 Don’t Be A Role, Be A Soul

- We are social animals, and as such, each of us has multiple roles that we perform in society.
- Roles are neither good nor bad. They are primarily functional and provide for some needed predictability in our lives, especially when it comes to interpersonal relationships
- When we disown parts of ourselves, we tend to judge others who display those same qualities.
- When we over-identify with a role, it defines us, confines us, and reduces our capacity for conscious choice.
- Too often in caregiving and other helping careers, we find ourselves not so much looking to see what serves others, but to confirm our socially approved identity.
- Rachel Naomi Remen, M.D.: “Helping, fixing, and serving represent three different ways of seeing life. When you help, you see life as weak. When you fix, you see life as broken. When you serve, you see life as whole. Fixing and helping may be the work of the ego, and service the work of the soul
- It wasn’t sameness; we didn’t need that to connect. It was a belonging that came about because all parts were honored.
- We become drained. To find our way home, we have to remember what called our souls to serve in the first place.

#### 9 Taming The Inner Critic

- No matter how you try, you can’t please your inner critic.
- in the critic’s eyes, nothing you do is good enough.
- Often in our most vulnerable moments, when we would benefit from tenderness, we club ourselves with self-judgment.
- in order to bring our whole self to the experience, we must address the often unconscious, corrosive voice of the inner critic. It is the primary obstacle to self-acceptance, trust, and the expansion of our dynamic potential.
- Chances are if you’re extremely critical of yourself, you’ll be a harsh critic of others.
- Embracing wholeness is a loving act of reclamation, a “both/and” way of meeting life.
- The critic doesn’t believe in our basic human goodness. It only believes in rules and moral codes.
- Pema Chödrön, who wrote, “The problem is that the desire to change yourself is fundamentally a form of aggression toward yourself
- Telling the emotional truth, expressing disinterest in the critic’s advice, using humor, staying connected to your physical center, harnessing your strength—all these strategies are meant to restore our contact with the dynamic expansiveness that is our essential nature.
- we often confuse acceptance with approval. Acceptance is a loving act of an open heart. Approval is generally tied up with judgment. Our hunger for approval is partly why we are so easily hooked by the critic.
- Even the seemingly unlovable pieces are loved because they are seen as part of the whole.

#### 10 The Raging River

- Mindfulness is a de-conditioning. It cultivates a merciful, awake presence of mind that no longer blocks the heart. Then things are free to be as they are.
- contain the emotion. This is a more balanced and creative response. We hold the emotions and the related material in a caring way. We accept the reality of their presence, regardless of whether we like them or not.
- Grief is a normal, natural response to loss. It is also natural to want to avoid it completely.
- Everyday grief arises when we remember how the carelessness of our actions has caused harm to others.
- Loss, losing, and loosening are simply common experiences that we might cycle through as we grieve, or that might suddenly explode to the surface of our awareness.

#### 11 Hearing The Cries Of The World

- we are not separate. We may appear so, but this is misperception, a conditioned view that shapes how we see ourselves and how we engage with each other.
- It can be helpful to consider the possibility that compassion is not a quality that we possess, but rather one that we access, inherent in the nature of reality. Love has been here all along.

### The Fourth Invitation Find A Place Of Rest In The Middle Of Things

#### 12 The Calm In The Storm

- we end up addicted to busy. We confuse rest with nonproductivity and laziness.
- With mindfulness, we start to see, “Oh, there are these currents moving through my mind, pushing me around.
- The critical point here is that while we need to be responsible to the impact these conditions have on our lives, we are not responsible for their appearance.
- we begin to think of ourselves as the temporary caretakers rather than the owners of what we have been given, and so we share our gifts open-handedly.
- trying to rest is not resting; it’s just more trying.
- We can only relax the activity that obstructs our contact with rest.
- One of the qualities of a truly open mind is deep restfulness. We come to this restfulness by accepting and understanding our desires, not by rejecting them. We surrender our strategies and resistance.
- Actually, I don’t even like the word acceptance—it has too many moral overtones. The word allow is better suited to what I am describing. It’s a softer word, a word that takes us beyond the concepts of accepting and rejecting altogether.

#### 13 Mind The Gap

- It helps us to remain calm and grounded
- In Buddhist circles, we often say, “Meditation doesn’t solve your problems; it dissolves them.”
- When we attempt to separate the sacred from the ordinary, we create a false dichotomy.

#### 14 Courageous Presence

- Fear can arise from an accurate perception of a situation, or from a completely distorted view.
- The goal is not to one day get rid of all fear. It is rather to free ourselves from fear’s choke hold around our lives, to learn to face our fear with courageous presence.
- There are three types of courage needed to live fully, face death directly, and discover true freedom: the courage of the warrior, the courage of a strong heart, and the courage of vulnerability.
- Vulnerability is not weakness; it is non-defensiveness. The absence of defense allows us to be wide open to our experience.
- If we are not willing to be vulnerable to pain, loss, and sadness, we’ll become insensitive to compassion, joy, love, and basic goodness.
- our capacity to be vulnerable also makes it possible for us to experience all levels of reality. We feel how permeable we actually are—how our identities are not fixed, nothing in existence is permanent.
- Donald Winnicott, a preeminent English pediatrician and psychologist, developed the concept of the “holding environment,” which is foundational to attachment theory in contemporary psychoanalysis.

### The Fifth Invitation Cultivate Don’T Know Mind

- Don’t know mind is one characterized by curiosity, surprise, and wonder. It is receptive, ready to meet whatever shows up as it is.
- It means that we know something, but it is the wrong thing. Ignorance is misperception.
- Don’t know mind represents something else entirely. It is beyond knowing and not knowing. It is off the charts of our conventional ideas about knowledge and ignorance. It is the “beginner’s mind” Zen master Suzuki Roshi spoke of

#### 15 The Story Of Forgetfulness

- it is this aversion to being out of control that leads us to distance ourselves from people who are confused.
- We associate memory with accuracy, and accuracy with truth, and truth with righteousness.
- memory is not objective, truthful, exact, or by any means permanent. Our memories are malleable constructs.
- Our stories about who we are and what we know are only a contraction of consciousness.

#### 16 Not Knowing Is Most Intimate

- Wisdom tells me I am nothing. Love tells me I am everything. Between the two, my life flows. — Nisargadatta Maharaj
= Not knowing is a gateway to a deeper appreciation of the potency of our basic nature, which cannot be known by the conceptual mind alone. It takes us beyond our ordinary way of thinking and seeing things, and into intimacy with this very moment.
- Emptiness is a difficult word for most Westerners. We normally associate empty with deficiency, sterility, a void. Most of us relate more easily to the words openness, spaciousness, or better still, boundlessness.

#### 17 Surrender To The Sacred

- the sacred is not something apart from us. It is here with us in every moment.
- Letting go is an entry into unknown territory. Grief is the toll that we pay. Tears are the fluids that ease the release.
- Surrender means moving into flow.
- You cannot float if you hold on too tightly. Surrender happens when we stop fighting
- Surrender is a state in which resistance of any kind ceases to occur. We no longer put up any defense.
- Surrender is infinitely deeper than letting go. Letting go is still a strategy of the mind occupied with the past.
- Surrender is the effortless, easeful non-doing of our essential nature without interference. We are simply aware.

#### Epilogue: Dying Into Life

Transformation requires an open-ended willingness to be fully vulnerable to the experience of the
unknown.
