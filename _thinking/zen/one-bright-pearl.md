> The whole universe is one bright pearl.

I've been finding that this koan is resonating for me at the moment. There's a brightness to experience, awareness. I'm having some feelings of loss, grief, sadness. But even those are bright. Not happy, or wanted, maybe not even helpful. But the quality of their appearance, of everything that's appearing, is bright. Bright like open, luminous, clear.

The other day I was walking home at lunchtime. I was feeling a bit down. It was a sunny day, and I decided to experiment with my posture. I raised my head up a bit, pushed my shoulders back a bit. Although I still felt down, there was also the brightness of the world. The (metaphorical (but also literal)) brightness Of all this, Just This, being and moving and interacting.

This is also feeling like a path for me into a more intuitive understanding of unity, that [Reality is one](/thinking/map/#reality-is-one). Of the non-separateness and interdependence of all things. Of the truth that every event is part of life, everything is included. This sounds really weird when I write it down! But it feels like it "makes sense" experientially.

## Excerpt from [Hsuan-sha's One Bright Pearl â€“ Dharma Discourse by Abbot John Daido Loori, M.R.O.](https://abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/C%20-%20Zen/Modern%20Teachers/John%20Daido%20Loori%20-%20Dharma%20Talks/DISCOURSE%20Hsuan-sha%27s%20One%20Bright%20Pearl.htm)

SB: In the intimacy of one bright pearl there's no way to understand because understanding requires separation.

> The great master Hsuan-sha was once asked by a monk, "The entire world of the ten directions is one bright pearl. How can I understand the meaning of this?"<br>Hsuan-sha said, "The entire world of the ten directions is one bright pearl. Why is it necessary to understand the meaning of this?"

Do you see the subtlety going on in this dialogue? If, indeed, the entire universe is just one thing, then the notion of meaning or understanding becomes a contradiction. There is no way to understand. When we talk of meaning or understanding we are of necessity talking about separation. We have to step back from what we are trying to understand to look at it, analyze it and describe it. In the intimacy of the "one bright pearl" there is no way to do that. Appreciating this, Hsuan-sha asked, "Why is it necessary to understand the meaning of this?"
