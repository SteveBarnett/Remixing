## Introduction
 
Koans aren't riddles to be solved.

Sit with the question. Let the "answer" come forth and reveal itself.

### On Koans

> **Koans are a good way to cool the assertiveness, to undermine and dismantle the whole intellectual matrix, while harnessing the energy of inquisitiveness and activating intuition.**

and

> Koans remain dark to the mind but radiant to the heart.

From [The Eight Gates of Zen](/thinking/zen/the-eight-gates-of-zen/)

> You do not just use your intellect in order to work on a koan. A koan should be buried deep in the soil of your mind.

From [Zen and the Art of Saving the Planet](/thinking/zen/zen-and-the-art-of-saving-the-planet/)

> Recollection of koans facilitates the ongoing practice of Buddhist meditations in the midst of ordinary wordly activities, once a popular Zen technique.

From [Kensho: Heart of Zen](/thinking/zen/kensho-heart-of-zen/).

### On Questions

> **Love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language.**

From [Deep Hope](/thinking/zen/deep-hope/)

> The answering is in the questioning.

From [Rational Zen](/thinking/zen/rational-zen/)

## Revisiting "The Gateless Gate" in "Zen Flesh, Zen Bones"

### Joshu's Dog

Monk: "Does a dog have Buddha-nature?"<br>
Joshu: "Mu" ("No thing" or "Nay")

Part of Mumon's comment: Let your previous lesser knowledge disappear. As a fruit ripening in season, your subjectivity and objectivity become one.

### Gutei's Finger ☝️

Gutei: "I attained my one-finger-Zen from my teacher Tenryu, and in my whole life I could not exhaust it."

Part of Mumon's comment: "Englightment, which Gutei obtained, has nothing to do with a finger."

### A Beardless Foreigner

Wakuan: "Why does Bodhidharma have no beard?"
