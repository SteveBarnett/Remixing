- Koans aren't riddles to be solved. They're pointers on the path (noting that path is goal is path).
- Sit with the question. Let the "answer" come forth and reveal itself.
- Part of the practice is to accept their unanswerability.

## On Koans

> **Koans are a good way to cool the assertiveness, to undermine and dismantle the whole intellectual matrix, while harnessing the energy of inquisitiveness and activating intuition.**

and

> Koans remain dark to the mind but radiant to the heart.

From [The Eight Gates of Zen](/thinking/zen/the-eight-gates-of-zen/)

> You do not just use your intellect in order to work on a koan. A koan should be buried deep in the soil of your mind.

From [Zen and the Art of Saving the Planet](/thinking/zen/zen-and-the-art-of-saving-the-planet/)

> Recollection of koans facilitates the ongoing practice of Buddhist meditations in the midst of ordinary wordly activities, once a popular Zen technique.

From [Kensho: Heart of Zen](/thinking/zen/kensho-heart-of-zen/).

## On Questions

> **Love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language.**

From [Deep Hope](/thinking/zen/deep-hope/)

> The answering is in the questioning.

From [Rational Zen](/thinking/zen/rational-zen/)

## Revisiting ["The Koan Way" on Waking Up](https://app.wakingup.com/practice/the-koan-way)

### One Bright Pearl

Gensha: The whole universe is one bright pearl.

### Ordinary Mind is The Way

Joshu: "What is The Way?"<br>
Nansen: "Ordinary Mind is The Way." <br>
Joshu: "Should I turn towards it?"<br>
Nansen: "If you turn towards it, you go against it."<br>
Joshu: "If I can't look for it, how can I ever find it?"<br>
Nansen: "The Way isn't about knowing or not knowing."

This moment as it is, ordinary experience, is The Way. Seen from a different vantage point.

### Not knowing is most intimate

Dizang asked Fayan, "Where are you going?"<br>
Fayan said, "Around on pilgrimage."<br>
Dizang said, "What is the purpose of pilgrimage?"<br>
Fayan said, "I don't know."<br>
Dizang said, "**Not knowing is most intimate.**"

### Original Face

**What is your Original Face? The face you had before even your parents were born.**

## Revisiting "The Gateless Gate" in "Zen Flesh, Zen Bones"

### Joshu's Dog

Monk: "Does a dog have Buddha-nature?"<br>
Joshu: "Mu" ("No thing" or "Nay")

Part of Mumon's comment: Let your previous lesser knowledge disappear. As a fruit ripening in season, your subjectivity and objectivity become one.

### Gutei's Finger ☝️

Gutei: "I attained my one-finger-Zen from my teacher Tenryu, and in my whole life I could not exhaust it."

Part of Mumon's comment: "Enlightenment, which Gutei obtained, has nothing to do with a finger."

### A Beardless Foreigner

Wakuan: "Why does Bodhidharma have no beard?"

### Joshu washes the bowl

Monk: "I have just entered the monastery. Please teach me."<br>
Joshu: "Have you eaten your rice porridge?"<br>
Monk: "I have."<br>
Joshu: "Then wash your bowl."

### Not the Wind, Not the Flag

Two monks were arguing about a flag. One said: "the flag is moving." The other said: "The wind is moving."<br>The sixth patriarch said: "**Not the wind, not the flag; mind is moving**"

### Proceed from the Top of the Pole

Sekiso asked: "How can you proceed on from the top of a hundred-foot pole?"
