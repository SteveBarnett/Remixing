## A few key points

- Learn what leads towards suffering and what leads away from suffering.
- When I *am* experience, there is no suffering. When I believe I'm separate from it, there is suffering.
- "When opposites arise, Buddha mind is lost."
- We do bad behaviours so we can continue to hate ourselves, not the other way around.
- Drinking and using drugs is wanting things to be be different, to leave an experience, which assumes there's something wrong.
- Learn to let go and relax into the moment. Your interest in being right, safe, under control begins to fall away.
- Where am I, not am I a good or a bad person.
- We can learn what we think is acceptable or not from where we draw the line.
- We sit in meditation to the let the spaces between our conditioning become larger.
- The quickest way to end your spiritual training is to use what you see against yourself.
    - If you beat yourself up every time you see something, you'll quickly stop seeing things.
- Here, centred in the moment, there are no problems.
