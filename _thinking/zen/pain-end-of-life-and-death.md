Gathering notes.

## [Understanding a Good Death - Zen Buddhism and the End of Life](https://zen-and-end-of-life.org/meditation/)

- few of us are likely to enjoy the privilege of the “good death”. It is true that within certain limits we can prepare for how we shall die, and hence influence our experience of dying, but these limits are narrowly set by the nature of whatever kind of physical deterioration eventually afflicts us.
- We are most likely to die in a coma or under heavy sedation. Long before that, the person who we recognisably are, to ourselves and to our friends and relations, may have become distorted almost beyond recognition.
- How we have lived is more important than how we die, over which we may very well have little or no control.
- More particularly, whatever our dying lot turns out to be, we can as from now prepare ourselves by the practice of bare awareness. Through this we can make the experience of our terminal afflictions more manageable and endurable, and can longer sustain our personal integrity.

## [A Buddhist Approach To Working With Pain: From Suffering To Liberation](https://www.bethspatterson.com/p/buddhist-approach-working-pain-suffering-liberation)

- My knee-jerk reaction when my pain flares up is self-pity. My self-centered thoughts and negative judgments increase my suffering. When I let go of my thoughts and focus instead on the direct experience of my pain, there is an immediate sense of relief and spaciousness.
- Explore the pain with a sense of curiosity

## [The Noble Truth of Pain - Tricycle: The Buddhist Review](https://tricycle.org/article/chronic-pain-suffering/)

- pain is not a disorder or a mistake.
- pain is an important part of life
- Pain, in fact, is good; it exists to warn us of danger. Of course there are all kinds of pain that aren’t helpful either because the pain continues after the danger has passed
- it’s still absolutely vital to recognize that pain is a necessary part of life and honor the work it does in keeping us safe and helping us to grow.
- So what does Zen have to say about pain, and how can our practice help us reorient our relationship with pain?
- pain is not an enemy that needs to be fought. Pain is a friend, a good friend. Just as it is only our closest friends who will tell us hard truths, pain is there to make sure we pay attention to problems and to respond quickly and appropriately.
- We promise ourselves to [do zazen and] be still and listen to what pain tells us so that we can become familiar with the messages and understand them in more drastic situations.
- pain is not separate from us, as our practice allows us to understand
- physical pain is not a separate thing that can be avoided or rejected or fixed, and that trying to do so only creates more suffering
- the way to deal with pain is not to ignore it or “rise above it.”
- nothing makes pain go away if it isn’t ready to go
- Practicing with pain is hard. But practice is intrinsically hard. ... directly contradicts the version of reality that our ego presents to us.
- while pain can be distracting, alienating, and upsetting, it can also be a powerful way to practice being present with what is—without stories or expectations. It can be a powerful way to experience, in a very embodied way, what reality actually is.
- This is an especially hard practice because we can’t practice with pain in order to get rid of pain.
- Recognize that the pain is not other than myself, that it is an intrinsic part of being alive. Breathe. Remember that pain is not the same thing as suffering. Breathe. Let go of my desire to be free of the pain. Breathe. Gently turn my attention to one of the other many aspects of the present moment

## [The Five Invitations](https://frankostaseski.com/books/)

- Don’t Wait
- Welcome Everything, Push Away Nothing
- Bring Your Whole Self to the Experience
- Find a Place of Rest in the Middle of Things
- Cultivate Don’t Know Mind

The Five Invitations are mutually supportive principles, permeated with love that are reliable guides for being with dying. And, as it turns out, they have a relevance for all of us in living a life of integrity, meaning and purpose. They can be understood as best practices for anyone navigating a life transition, coping with loss or serious illness or a personal crisis. They guide us toward appreciating life’s preciousness. The Five Invitations is a powerful and inspiring exploration of the essential wisdom dying has to show about waking up fully to our lives.

## [My "The Palliative Society" notes](/thinking/the-palliative-society/)

- Today, algophobia rules. Pain is cast as personal, private, a failure, an attack.
- Modern society is in permanent anaethesia.
- Modern society has: little space for conflict, difference, negativity; more pressure to conform, be the same, be positive.
- Pain initiates and carries narrative.
