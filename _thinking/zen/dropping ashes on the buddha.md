- Keeping **don’t-know mind** always and everywhere is the true practice of Zen.
- **Everything is our main practice.**
    - When sitting, only sit. When talking, only talk. When working, only work.
    - Don't think, just practice.
    - Just sit, and keep don't-know mind, not-moving mind.
- **Names and forms are made by thinking. Before thinking there are no names and forms.**
    - When we're attached to something, they're different. When we're not attached, they're the same.
    - Something having a quality means we have an opinion, a thought. We've been checking, evaluating.
    - Opposites are mutual. Their names and forms are different, but their substance is the same.
        - As soon as we think "good", we create "bad".
        - "Like" and "don't like" are both attachments.
- Don't be attached to thinking or to not-thinking.
    - Don't be upset by anything that goes on in our mind.
    - When the mind becomes clear it's like a mirror.
- Intuitive action, wu wei, means acting without any desire of attachment.
    - **Don't think. Just do what must be done.**
- Consider a bell.
    - If you say it's a bell, you are attached to name and form.
    - If you say it's not a bell, you are attached to emptiness.
    - Is this a bell or not?
    - **Picking up the bell and ringing it is a complete answer.**
    - The verb, the action, of **being without thinking** or desire or attachment.

## Raw notes

- The truth is that all things in the universe are just as they are.
- If you keep the mind that is before thinking, that is Zen mind.
- Opposites are mutual. Their names and forms are different, but their substance is the same. **Names and forms are made by your thinking.**
- **Intuitive action means acting without any desire of attachment.**
- Anything can be written in a book, anything can be said–all this is thinking.
- You must keep don't-know mind always and everywhere. This is the true practice of Zen.
- **When the mind becomes clear, it is like a mirror.** Red comes and the mirror is red; yellow comes and the mirror is yellow.
- **It's very important not to be attached either to thinking or to not-thinking. You mustn't be upset by anything that goes on in your mind.** Only don't worry and keep don't-know mind.
- Wanting enlightenment is only thinking.
- Zen is not difficult. If you say it is difficult, then means you have been checking yourself, checking your situation, your condition, your opinions.
- Zen is not difficult. And it is not easy. It is only as it is. **Don't make difficult, don't make easy. Just practice.**
- Is anything your perceive outside your mind. Then how do you know what it is? Does your mind fly out of your eyes and touch it then fly back inside?
- People make the words. **A cat doesn't say "I am a cat." People say "this is a cat."**
- **After thinking, there are opposites. Before thinking, there are no opposites.**
- **"Difficult" is thinking, "easy" is thinking.**
- Noisy and quiet are made by your thinking. If you think something is noisy, it is noisy. If you think something is quiet, it is quiet.
- An elementary koan. If you say it's a stick, you're attached to name and form. If you say it's not a stick, you're attached to emptiness. So is it a stick or not?
    - Saying it's both is doubly wrong. **A stick is made by thinking. It does not say "I'm a stick." People make it a stick.**
- If you have not attained enlightenment, everything is different. If you attain enlightenment, all things become one.
- Acting together means cutting off your opinions, your condition, your situation.
- **When we have many desires and many opinions, there are many big waves. After we sit Zen for a while, the waves become smaller.**
- "I want to cut off anger." – this is thinking. Anger is not bad, not good. Only don't be attached to it.
- **First understand that form is emptiness, emptiness is form. Then understand no form, no emptiness. Then form is form, emptiness is emptiness.**
- Don't-know mind has no Buddha, no Dharma, no good, no bad, no light, no dark.
- When you are thinking, our minds are different. When you are not thinking, our minds are the same.
- **As soon as you say "mind," you create "not-mind".**
- When you think death, you make death. When you think life, you make life. Where you are not thinking, there is not life and no death.
- If I am attached to shikantaza or koans, then they are different. If I am not attached, they are the same.
- Understanding and attaining are different.
- If you are thinking, samadhi and enlightenment are different. If you cut off thinking, samadhi and enlightenment are the same. But when we explain them, they are different.
- **Like and don't like are both attachments**, hindrances in your mind.
- **Put it all down.**
- In true stillness, in true nature, in true emptiness, there is no appearing or disappearing, no impermanence or permanence, no form or emptiness.
- **Merely do what must be done.**
- **Thinking is no good, so put it all down.**
- **Sitting means cutting off all thinking and keeping not-moving mind.**
- **There is no difference between good sitting and bad sitting, between clarity and anxiety.**
- **Understanding is thinking. Attainment is before thinking.**
- **Here is a bell.**
    - **If you say it's a bell, you are attached to name and form.**
    - **If you say it's not a bell, you are attached to emptiness.**
    - **Is this a bell or not?**
    - **Picking up the bell and ringing it is a complete answer.**
- **Name and form are not necessary.**
- **Everything is your main practice.** When sitting, only sit. When talking, only talk. When working, only work.
