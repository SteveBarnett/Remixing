## Intro

- **The more you seek enlightenment, the more you lose it.**
- The aim of Zen is to become immune to being conditioned into altered states, away from original mind.
- **If you try to avoid something, it's still affecting you.**
- Don't cling to sense data, let them be, without hindrance.
- Emphasis on emptiness aline tends to produce nihilism and decadence.
- Emphasis on phenomena alone tends to not produce liberation.
- **Discipline, meditation, and knowledge are all necessary to cultivate virtue and to get rid of **craving.
- Zen aims to strip students of sentimental attachments.
- Neither mechanical performance nor mere theory will foster enlightenment.
- **Enlightenment is inherent in everyone, but it needs to be practiced to manifest and be directly experienced.**

## Universal Book of Eternal Peace

- Three exercises: contemplating impermanence of the subject; contemplating impermanence of the object; alterness in the immediate present.
- Remove obstructing fixations.
- Realisation of the absolute does not extinguish experience of the relative.
- **As long as the idea of something to be transcended remains, this obscures our inherent **Buddha-nature.
- The integration of the absolute and relative doesn't obliterate their distinctness.
- When "someone" understands, the understanding is already secondhand.
- **Tranquilising yourself deprives you of useful stimuli for conscious development.**
- By not grasping or rejecting we can be undisturbed in the midst of the world without shutting anything** out.**
- The ominpresence  of reality does not obstruct the ubiquitousness of the illusion.
- **Hover above the duality of the absolute and the relative.**
- Only suchness and knowledge of suchness.
- Jar the mind out of its self-limiting, routine outlook, and thinking patterns.

## Treasury of Eyes of True Teaching

- Good and evil are products of relations, not pre-existing inherent qualities.
- First there is effort, then spontaneity.
- No longer a slave to compulsion or coercion, internal or external.
- **Don't notch the side of a boat to mark where something went overboard.**
- **Be free in the midst of it all.**
- Be able to use or not use whatever's available to you as an individual.
- **Act without attachment. Act spontaneously, without contrivance.**
- Don't grasp the world and oneself, don't reject the world and oneself.
- All things being interdependent means that each individual implies the whole, and the whole implies each individual.
- The essence of mind, bypassing the feelings and thoughts produced by the function of mind.
- **Charity and service are manifestations of the attitude of enlightenment.**
- Be fluid and free, not pinned down by mental fixations.
- The practice may have played a role in opening the mind, but what's important is the effect of the opening.
- '"The Land of Eternally Silent Light" - Tendai Buddhist name for the absolute.'
- **If mind and things were separate, there would be no possiblity of awareness of things.**
- Ultimate reality is innocent of the descriptions projected upon it by conceptual and linguistic habits.
- **Knowledge without action is useless. Action with knowledge is dangerous.**
- Free up energy by letting go perceptual and cognitive boundaries produced by fixation on limited views.
 ** star: true**
- The middle way is the simultaneous awareness of both perspectives.
- **As soon as you think "this is it," it's not it anymore.**
- Using brings up potential, being used throws it away.
- **The answering is in the questioning.**
- Anticipation of enlightenment keeps the mind entangled in subjectivity.
- **The unity of the absolute and the relative is the consummation of Zen practice.**
- **Service without expectation of reward is one of the keynotes of the boddhisattva path.**
