- Everything is our main practice: my Zen HAM.
- Over the months my focus of my practice turned more towards embodied things, health and exercise.
- My sitting turned more towards noticing and more away from judging and having opinions.

## Some raw notes

### Always and already

- Buddha-nature is inherent, close, but temporarily concealed.
- It's always and already here.

### Path as goal

- We practice to manifest enlightenment, actualise it.
- Every step on the path is the path.
- Take the path as the goal.
- Practice and enlightenment are one.
- Sit hard and sit a great deal.
- Have no attachment to the outcome.
- Just sitting is enacting nonduality, no-self.
- "Just" as in nothing else, no turning away, no "in order to."
- Practice is ongoing embodiment.

### Chasing takes you away

- Chasing the way takes you away from it.
- Thinking about it obscures it.
- Progress on the path is not linear.

### The Absolute

- Thinking makes qualities, in particular opposites.
- The Absolute is free of concepts, language.
- Your true nature has no characteristics.
- Your true nature is the context of consciousness, not the contents.
- The senses create forms, like echoes in a valley.
- "Not the wind moving, not the flag moving, mind moving."

### Unity

- The Absolute and the Relative integrated, in union.
- The unity of birds and sky, fish and water.

### Only the whole

- The ends of a stick aren't required, only the whole.
- The knower and the know aren't required, only the knowing, the verb.
- Subject and object arise as a pair.
- We should say "it's thinking" like "it's raining".

### No problems

- The infinite causes and conditions of Reality create everything.
- There are no problems, no choices.
- Liberation is seeing through the illusion of there being a problem.
- Life, as it is, is enough.
- Fully engaged with how it is, as it is, not how it "should" be.
- Our ideas of happiness can stop us being happy.
- Notice the causes and conditions that lead to your suffering.
- The things that are most difficult for us have the most to teach us.

### No choices

- We're not doing in the world, the world is doing us, like it does trees and rivers.
- Spontaneous action, like laughing at a joke.
- Actions require an agent manifesting a purpose.
- Rain doesn't need a rainer, a doer.
- Being without thinking: without desire, attachment, opinions.

### Separation

- Separation from experience creates suffering.
- The way to be liberating from suffering is to be quickly absorbed into it.
- If mind and things were separate, we couldn't be aware of things.
- Thinking about knowing separates, creates a knower and the known.
- "Not-knowing is most intimate."
- Dwell on the open, spacious, possible.
- Don't cling to a position.
- Direct perception, not conceptual description.
- Rest in the wider space of awareness.

### Letting go

- Don't grasp or reject. Don't push or pull.
- Avoiding something means its still affecting you.
- Just notice without judgement. Be open, curious.
- Judgement creates barriers, separation.
- Only cease to cherish opinions, like and not-like.
- Zen master Seng-ts'an reminds us: â€œDo not search for the truth; only cease to cherish opinions."
- Choosing obscures the way.
- Just notice, in the midst of it all.

### Questioning

- The answering is in the questioning.
- Koans are dark to the mind, radiant to the heart.

### Every minute Zen

- The mundane as transcendent, sacred.
- Everything is our main practice.

- In a still mind, the self is forgotten.
- Thoughts tend to disintegrate in the light of awareness.

### Take care

- Take care of your suffering.
- Running away only prolongs pain.
- Take care of all the parts of yourself.

<!-- - To be is to inter-be. -->

<!-- - All things flow. -->
