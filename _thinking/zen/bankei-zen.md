## Gathered and lightly jiggled notes

- The Buddha Mind is unborn and marvelously illuminating.
- That which is unborn is the source of all things. There’s nothing prior to it.
- No-one is born with any sort of vice.
- Don't try to become a Buddha, take the shortcut: remain a Buddha!
- By wanting to realise enlightenment, you create a duality between the one who realises enlightenment and what it is that’s being realised.
- That which is unborn transcends thought. It’s when thoughts arise that you experience suffering and joy.
- As soon as you think of wanting to be enlightened, you leave the place of the Unborn and go counter to it.
- Just do good things and don’t do bad ones. Don't become attached to them.
- Remain just as you innately are and your own intrinsic nature will be revealed.
- Students of the Way must first of all take care to watch where they’re going. Every step in the wrong direction takes you further away.

## Opening of the Sermons

The Buddha Mind is unborn and marvelously illuminating.

## Listen carefully

- Nobody here can claim he heard these sounds because he’d made up his mind beforehand to listen for them when they were made. So, in fact, you’re listening with the Unborn.
-  That which is unborn is the source of all things, the starting point of all things. There’s nothing more original than the Unborn, nothing prior to it.
- When you abide in the Unborn, you’re abiding at the source of all things.

## Growing up deluded

Who’s born with any sort of vice? No one’s born that way.

## Don’t beat sleeping monks

Rather than trying to become a buddha, nothing could be simpler than taking the shortcut of remaining
a buddha!

## Self-centeredness

One day, the Master addressed the assembly: “All delusions, without exception, are created as a result of self-centeredness. When you’re free from self-centeredness, delusions won’t be produced."

## Everybody has the Buddha Mind

The Unborn Buddha Mind you all intrinsically possess.

## Being living buddhas

Even though you’re not trying to hear these things in the course of the sermon, each of the different
sounds is heard

## “Buddha” Magoemon

- Because the Buddha Mind is present in each one of you, there’s no question of my giving you the Buddha Mind.
- Realize the preciousness of the Buddha Mind, and even if you don’t want to, you’ll find yourself having to abide in the Unborn!

## Illness and the Buddha Mind

- When you conclusively realize the Unborn Buddha Mind, you don’t distress yourself over the sufferings of illness: you clearly distinguish illness as illness, suffering as suffering.
- That which is unborn transcends thought. It’s when thoughts arise that you experience suffering and joy.

## Being free in birth and death

From the place of the Unborn, birth and death and nirvana too are just a lot of empty speculation.

## To practice is hard

From the standpoint of the Unborn, intellectual understanding too is empty speculation,

## Mu

The crows go kaa-kaa, the sparrows, chuu-chuu

## Looking for enlightenment

By wanting to realize enlightenment, you create a duality between the one who realizes enlightenment and what it is that’s being realized.

## The mirror

With the dynamic function of the marvelously illuminating Buddha Mind, every object that comes
before your eyes is individually recognized and distinguished without your doing a thing. So, even
though you’re not trying to do so, you recognize thousands of different impressions by sight or by
sound.

## Be stupid!

The true man’s ideal is to show kindness to those who are foolish and help those who are evil.

“What I’m talking about isn’t the stupidity of stupidity and understanding. That which transcends stupidity and understanding is what I mean by stupidity!”

## Smoking

Take smoking: Is there anyone who’s a smoker right from birth? No, indeed! Seeing others smoke, you
imitate them, and then your smoking becomes ingrained and turns into a bad habit.

## No such thing as enlightenment

- Without rousing a single thought, it’s all smoothly managed, isn’t it?.
- There’s no such thing as enlightenment. It’s a completely extraneous pursuit. To realize conclusively that the Buddha Mind you have from your parents innately is unborn and marvelously illuminating—that’s enlightenment. Not realizing this makes you deluded.
- Since the Original Buddha Mind is unborn, it functions without thoughts of delusion or thoughts of wanting to be enlightened. As soon as you think of wanting to be enlightened, you leave the place of the Unborn and go counter to it.
-  Because the Buddha Mind is unborn, it has no thoughts at all. Thoughts are the source of delusion.

## When thoughts arise

In the Buddha Mind, there aren’t any thoughts or ‘things’; so when you don’t get yourself involved with them, don’t worry about trying to get rid of them or stop them, you’ll just naturally accord with the Unborn Buddha Mind.

## Duality

Thoughts don’t originally exist, but only arise and cease temporarily in response to what you see and hear, without any actual substance of their own.

## The living Buddha Mind

Just do good things and don’t do bad ones. If you pride yourself on [your] good deeds, however, becoming attached to them and abominating the bad, that’s going against the Buddha Mind.

## The “teetotaler”

Delusory thoughts are like this too. When you simply let them arise or cease, without either taking them up or rejecting them, then, before you know it, they’ll vanish in the Mind of the Unborn.

## Just as you are

Zazen is just another name for original mind, and means to sit in tranquility with a tranquil mind.

## Everything is smoothly managed

Even wanting to attain buddhahood right away is something artificial. When you realize that you’re producing all aspirations yourself and, without getting involved with particular things, remain just as you innately are, your own intrinsic nature will be revealed.

## The great doubt

‘As soon as you speak about a thing, you miss the mark.’ This is the real great doubt and great
enlightenment.

## Layman Chōzen

The Master said: “People all value enlightenment, but Chōzen was lucky enough to destroy
enlightenment and become a man of perfect freedom.”

## Watch where you’re going

- Students of the Way must first of all take care to watch where they’re going.
- [But] if he mistakenly sets off to the west, even if it’s just a single step [at first], the more he exerts himself, the further from Edo he’ll be.”
