At the start of 2024, [I decided to commit to Zen for the year](/themes/2024/#philosophy). Study, practice, and life more broadly. In July 2024 I made some [Notes from six months of studying and practicing Zen](/thinking/zen/notes-from-six-months-of-studying-and-practicing-zen/).

## Some new angles

- No escape
- No answers
- No separation
- No goal
- No thinking

But not in a bleak way! ðŸ˜…

### A bit more detail, somewhat swirly

- No escape from the fundamental anxiety of a being a human, having visceral feeling that things arenâ€™t right
    - Committed to seeing everything we encounter, good and bad, pleasant and painful, as a manifestation of awakened energy
    - Use pain and difficulties to learn more about what it is to be human
    - Stopping and taking care of painful emotions as soon as they come up
    - Deeply understanding that thinking one day weâ€™ll get somewhere problem-free is what keeps us miserable
    - **Giving everything that arises a warm welcome**
    - Use whatever happens as an opportunity to wake up, to soften
    - Tolerating more discomfort, especially witnessing without being able to do anything tangible to help
- No definitive answers
    - **Being able to accept the unanswerability and unresolvability of life**
    - Knowing that many teachings, such as koans, things are dark to the mind but radiant to the heart
    - Not knowing is most intimate
    - Giving up fixed ideas about ourselves, others, the world
    - Cultivating openness, leaving space, being open to possibilities
    - Embracing contextual rather than absolute answers
        - Using ethics and common sense rather than be constrained and limited by them
        - Pushing past the habits and patterns of what we think works for our lives
- No separation between subject and object, between self and other, between self and world
    - **The whole universe is one bright pearl**
    - The non-separateness and interdependence of all things
    - Everything is included, showing up together all at once, with distinctions but not division
    - The infinite causes and conditions of Reality creating everything
- **No goal, no attachment to a particular outcome, no intention to gain something**
    - Just sitting, only sitting
    - The feeling of non-doing, wu wei
- No thinking, but not as in no thoughts
    - As long as weâ€™re human, thoughts will come up no matter how hard we practice zazen
    - We canâ€™t get rid of thoughts â€“ thinking thoughts is what the mind does
    - Abstract concepts and living reality are entirely different
    - **Direct, personal, experience**, intuitive sensing, rather than  analytical thought and intellectual understanding
    - Insight and wisdom are lived experiences that cannot be encapsulated in words

## How am I behaving differently?

- More easily sliding into a sit, particularly when stressed
- "Just sitting" â€“ no goal, no desired outcome
- Holding opinions more lightly
- Having more frequent, deeper, dips into some kind of nondual experience
    - Feelings of oneness, unity, love
    - Direct experience of "One Bright Pearl"
- More often giving everything that arises a warm welcome
