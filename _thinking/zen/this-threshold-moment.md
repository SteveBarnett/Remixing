- "The mind of before-knowing" – Dogen's phrasing of don't-know mind
- Poetry and koans are gates to don't-know mind, tools of awakening, acupuncture of the the mind
- Case 18 of Mumonkan / The Gateless Gate: Three pounds of flax
- **Great Doubt**
- **What a wonder that everything enters but the heart is never overcrowded.**

## [Try Softer by James Crews](https://jamescrews.substack.com/p/try-softer)

> Honor wherever you are,<br>
whether the door to your life<br>
has blown off its hinges,<br>
or you find the simplest joy<br>
sitting in a patch of winter sun<br>
on that corner of the carpet<br>
where you love to stretch.<br>
Try softer, not harder—<br>
giving yourself a safe place<br>
to land your attention, resting<br>
in this threshold moment<br>
through which wind, snow<br>
and light all enter alike.

> so much depends<br>upon<br><br>a red wheel<br>barrow<br><br>glazed with rain<br>water<br><br>beside the white<br>
chickens
