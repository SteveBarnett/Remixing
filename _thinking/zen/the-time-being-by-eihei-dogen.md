- Time itself is being, and all being is time
- Reflect now whether any being or any world is left out of the present moment 
- Do not think that time merely flies away. Do not see flying away as the only function of time. If time merely flies away, you would be separated from time.
- The time-being has the quality of flowing. So-called today flows into tomorrow, today flows into yesterday, yesterday flows into today.
- Just actualize all time as all being; there is nothing extra
