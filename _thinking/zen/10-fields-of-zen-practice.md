Notes from [Ten Fields of Zen Practice Chapter One: What Is Zen Practice? - The Zen Studies Podcast](https://zenstudiespodcast.com/zen-practice-ten-fields/).

- Zen is about what we do, not what we believe.
- To access true happiness and peace, we have to transcend the sense of separate self.
- Not aiming to attain anything.
- "Practising to get better" and "practising because it's how we want to be" balance each other excesses out.
- Progress on the path is not straightforward, linear.
- A true person of Zen is:
	- kind, generous, can laugh at themselves;
	- present, grounded, flexible, receptive;
	- aware of their shortcomings, apologises sincerely without defensiveness or self-recrimination.
- **Practice is like walking in a fine mist. After some time you find you are thoroughly wet.**
