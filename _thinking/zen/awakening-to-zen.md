Notes from [Awakening to Zen by Roshi Philip Kapleau](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6556673-awakening-to-zen)

## Direct notes

- Experience for yourself this limitless universe–touch it, taste it, feel it, be it. Thoroughly savour it. Don't speculate about life and the world. Live it!

### Author's Preface

- ... alert wisdom of one walks the Path in the midst of life

### Part I: Living Zen In America

#### What is Zen? (1973)

- Koans are Zen's method of demonstrating truth directly without recourse to logic or reason.
- More often that not, such questions [about what Zen is, about what a Zen person does] are a dodge, a subterfuge to avoid facing up to one's own life problems.
- [You have everything you need to save yourself. Why, the, don't you do so and stop engaging in speculations?]
- The average person is perpetually weaving ideas and embroidering notionsn *about* what they see or hears.
- Basho: "How fortunate the person who sees a flash of lightning and does not think 'How brief life is!'"
- **With each mental judgement or colouration the viewer or hearer is being take farther and farther away from the object itself, the experience itself, so their knowledge becomes correspondingly weaker and more distant and limited.**
- Every explanation, no matter how subtle, is but looking from a single side at something that has infinite dimensions.
- The aim on Zen training is awakening, and **the living of a life that is creative, harmonious, and alive.**
- **"Life in its unconditioned integrity calls for Zen no more than water calls for wetness or fire for heat"**

#### Towards a Meaning of Buddhism for Americans (1964)

- **Many people, proudly calling themselves seekers, become attached to the idea of searching, and so they never find.**

#### Waking Up With Zen (1974)

- **What else is there but the pure act itself?**
- Respect the worth of every single object
- Technology makes "major contributions to minor needs of man" (ref: "Science makes major contributions to minor needs" Justice Holmes)

#### Valuing Life (1974)

- A reverence for life that opens our hearts to those whom we regard as a nuisance or even as our enemies.

#### Thanksgiving: A Life of Gratitude (1975)

- We need to be just as grateful for the difficulties as for the enjoyment and pleasure, for is is through our sufferings that we have the chance to grow and enrich our lives.

### Part II: Ethics, Responsibility, Practice

#### Responsibility and Social Action

- In Buddhism, compassion and wisdom are the qualities that develop out of your practice
- Gradually you can act without being attached to the result and simply do what you feel needs to be done
- If you're striving for particular results, then you're attached. If you're striving to be unattached, then you're committing another kind of subtle fault.
- The middle way, concerned with individual change but also with the context of social change, yet ultimately with something greater than either or both
- Let the world's pain come into your zazen and see the great exertion that will emerge

#### Pain, Suffering, and Resistance to Practice

- It is fundamental that we can't help anybody until we first help ourselves. Until we have enough, we have nothing to spare.
    - [I don't agree with this. Or maybe the framing that someone has to be "finished" before helping someone else]
- When there is no struggle in life, when things are provided, then a deep boredom can set in, a real inner dissatisfaction. There's nothing to strive for anymore and this provides its own pain,

#### Mind-Altering Drugs: Commentary and Reflections

- Underlying this attitude is the notion that it is senseless, if not downright masochistic, to endure even small amounts of pain and discomfort when ways can be found to escape or mitigate them
- Satori is like the sudden flipping over of a watch. Here's the back! Now for the first time you realise that a watch actually consists of face plus a back. And that this has always been so.

### Part III: Zen Training / Zen Teaching

#### Dokusan: A Private Encounter with the Roshi

- The disciple cannot boast of increased knowledge as a result of contact with the roshi, for nothing at all has been gained. Rather, much has been lost–chesty opinions, sticky notions of how things should or should not be, rash judgements, evaluations, deluded ideas, preconceptions.
- By responding as he does [seeming non-sequitur, in a koan], the master not only avoids a meaningless abstraction but beings the questioner down to earth, to the concrete and the real, where Zen operates.

#### Pilgrimage as Training and Practice

- What is objectionable is not name and form but clinging to names or forms.

#### The Englightened One

- This doesn't mean that an enlightened person simply acts as they please, indifferent to the consequences of those actions on others. Nor do they deliberately flout conventional laws in the name of freedom. Rather by identifying with them completely, such a person transcends them and thus is no longer obstructed by them.

#### Discipline and Naturalness

- take natural to mean spontaneous, free-flowing, creative, without compulsiveness, without regret or remorse

#### Impatience in Practice

- Pains and pressures often come up because of an overeagerness in practice. ... an overeagerness to get something out of Zen.

### Part IV: On Ilness, Dying and Death

- A good koan has a "bite" to it, a contradictory element that cannot be logically resolved.
- There is nothing to say, nothing to teach, nothing to point to, nothing to know, and no questions and answers to be concerned with
- Instead of "why me?", we could more profitably ask "Why not me?"
