### Part I: Living Zen In America

#### What is Zen? (1973)

- Koans are Zen's method of demonstrating truth directly without recourse to logic or reason.
- More often that not, such questions [about what Zen is, about what a Zen person does] are a dodge, a subterfuge to avoid facing up to one's own life problems.
- [You have everything you need to save yourself. Why, the, don't you do so and stop engaging in speculations?]
- The average person is perpetually weaving ideas and embroidering notionsn *about* what they see or hears.
- Basho: "How fortunate the person who sees a flash of lightning and does not think 'How brief life is!'"
- **With each mental judgement or colouration the viewer or hearer is being take farther and farther away from the object itself, the experience itself, so their knowledge becomes correspondingly weaker and more distant and limited.**
- Every explanation, no matter how subtle, is but looking from a single side at something that has infinite dimensions.
- The aim on Zen training is awakening, and **the living of a life that is creative, harmonious, and alive.**
- **"Life in its unconditioned integrity calls for Zen no more than water calls for wetness or fire for heat"**

#### Towards a Meaning of Buddhism for Americans (1964)

- **Many people, proudly calling themselves seekers, become attached to the idea of searching, and so they never find.**

#### Waking Up With Zen (1974)

- **What else is there but the pure act itself?**
- Respect the worth of every single object
- Technology makes "major contributions to minor needs of man" (ref: "Science makes major contributions to minor needs" Justice Holmes)

#### Valuing Life (1974)

- A reverence for life that opens our hearts to those whom we regard as a nuisance or even as our enemies.

#### Thanksgiving: A Life of Gratitude (1975)

- We need to be just as grateful for the difficulties as for the enjoyment and pleasure, for is is through our sufferings that we have the chance to grow and enrich our lives.
