Notes from [Less Foolishism Part 3: Ten Core Techniques](https://lessfoolish.substack.com/p/less-foolishism-part-3-ten-core-techniques?publication_id=34046&post_id=165288698&isFreemail=true&r=13ali&triedRedirect=true)

## My key points

- Keep don't-know mind, keep asking questions
- Attune to the good, the true, the beautiful
- Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis (meta, higher-order, preserves and transforms both)
- Use good 2&times;2s
- Hold theories lightly

## Socratic Ignorance

- “I know that I know nothing.”
- the state of unknowingness itself—what is called aporia.

## Socratic Questioning

- ask a question.
- Then another.
- And another.
- Keep asking until your interlocutor and you reach the state of aporia.

## Poetic Attunement

- “technological attunement” vs “poetic attunement.” In the former, you treat reality as a resource to be used, focusing on what it can do for us. In the latter, you relate to reality as something to be with, open to what could happen together, in relationship.
- attune ourselves to the three transcendentals: the good, the true, and the beautiful.
- Now, with the three fundamental dispositions—ignorance, the question, and attunement—we can begin to philosophize about what matters most for a person.

## Tracing the X-knot

- An existential knot (x-knot) is an issue that feels deeply personal, most saliently experienced as a felt sense, and accompanied by great difficulty in coherently describing what the issue actually is. ... If the existential knot remains tied, an “existential crisis” follows.
- The three most common x-knots in my practice are:
    - Meaning of life confusions
    - Relationship confusions
    - Livelihood confusions

## Based Definitions

Instead of relying on official sources, you check in with Source itself and come up with your own definitions

## Concept Unfolding

(Create your own concepts.)

When key words are defined, new concepts emerge, and a conversation between concepts begins.

## Hegelian Dialectic

- The initial idea (thesis) meets its opposing challenge (antithesis), and from their tension arises a new truth (synthesis).
- A synthesis is not a compromise or a simple middle ground. It is a higher-order, “meta” perspective that both preserves and transforms the previous terms.

## 2x2fu

A good 2x2 can bring greater clarity.

## Forming Arguments

- The standard argument form is a syllogism, where two premises support a conclusion. This can be expressed as an argument stanza or map. 
- Formed arguments in the wild are usually polysyllogisms or complex arguments (multi-premised arguments). 
    - Premise 1
    - Premise 2
    - Conclusion 1, now Premise 3
    - Premise 4
    - Conclusion 2
- The truth of poetic statements depends on them being false. They are not true in the narrow, classical logic sense, but rather in a holistic sense. This kind of truth is determined by one’s felt experience of resonance when reading with a disposition open to the whole.

## Theory Sketches

- If you have the following: clear definitions, new concepts, a dialectic, a 2x2, and good arguments, and if the inquiry is situated from an x-knot and some form of evidence exists, then you have the basis of a theory
- The technique here is cultivating a theory with a certain disposition: non-attachment.
