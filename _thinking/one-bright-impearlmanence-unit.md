Mashing up [One Bright Pearl](/thinking/zen/one-bright-pearl/), [Unity](/thinking/unity-the-absolute/), and Impermanence.

## One Bright Pearl

- The whole universe is one bright pearl
- There’s a brightness to experience, awareness
- The quality of of everything that’s appearing, is bright, open, luminous, clear
- Every event is part of life, everything is included
- In the intimacy of one bright pearl there’s no way to understand because understanding requires separation

## Unity

- The infinite causes and conditions of Reality creating everything
- Everything showing up together all at once, with distinctions but not division
- The direct experience of it is an objective view that includes us, not subject a view from am “I”

## Flux and flow

- Things are constantly changing and changeable
- Reality is in constant flux and motion
- Everything flows, changes, is impermanent
- The cosmos is consciousness as a verb
- Only the verb: no subject, no object
- Everything, including our sense of self, is a process

## Impermanence

- Impermanence is necessary for life and growth
- With impermanence comes uncertainty and unpredictability
    - These two characteristics of the human condition can be a deep source of anxiety and stress for us because we crave the opposite: security and assurance
- To notice impermanence, be still and watch as things change
- We maintain our sense of self by editing of, selecting from, experience, by resisting impermanence
- Impermanence sounds scary until we realize how complete it is
- Impermanence is so complete that no solid, separate, persisting things ever form in the first place to even be impermanent
- Thoroughgoing impermanence, vanishing as soon as it appears
- Things are constantly arising and passing away
- Recognize impermanence, and let that intensify the preciousness
- In the midst of impermanence and interdependence, we can only do our best
- In Buddhism, impermanence is often referred to as the “Law of Change and Becoming”
    - These two correlated principles provide balance and harmony
    - Just as there is constant “dissolving,” there is also constant “becoming"
- Impermanence is more than an idea: it's a practice to help us touch reality
- From the point of view of time, we say impermanence. From the point of view of space, we say non-self.
- When we resist impermanence, the feeling of self intensifies
- The more closely we observe the present moment, the more amorphous it becomes
