- Perfectionism leaves us unhappy and dissatisfied with our achievements
- Instead see(k) the balanced view
    - Acknowledge that sometimes we come up short
    - But root our sense of self-worth in being a flawed human being doing the best we can in the moment
- Acceptance, self-compassion, and self-forgiveness let our imperfections become signposts on the path rather than obstacles on the path
    - Bring attention to pain and unmet needs
    - Refuse to play the rigged game of “not good enough”
- Keep don’t-know mind
- Continued recommitment to aligning our actions with our values

## Gathering notes from other pages

As humans, we’re imperfect, incomplete, unresolved. But/and compassion lets us also see our wholeness and completeness.

- It helps to see the balanced view of ourselves. Our patterns and imperfections. Our basic innate goodness.
- Accepting our imperfections lets them become part of the path rather than obstacles on the path.
- Self-forgiveness mitigates negative affect, turns avoid into approach.

Every act carries some chance of mistake. When we proceed slowly we can learn from our mistakes.

- Stay engaged and committed to aligning our actions with our values.
- Striving for changes, but/and being at peace with the way it is.
- Keep going. Begin again. Drop the story. Don’t get lost in shame, guilt, or self-hatred.

- The way out is acceptance, rejecting the rigged game of “not good enough”
- Using self-compassion, self-forgiveness, to turn avoid into approach
- Bringing attention to pain and unmet needs

Using the mirror metta style to sneak around any resistance.

Taking the imperfect, incomplete, unresolved human life as a koan.

---

- Refusing to play the rigged game
- Don’t-know mind
- Both/and instead of either/or
- Question, maybe reject, the scripts for what counts as a good life
- Find escapes and tricks for the most problematic norms
- Using an inner compass instead of an outer map
- Find your core set of values and don’t compromise

- Letting go of the illusion of control is also a game changer, especially for those with the personality trait of perfectionism.
- Even when you do everything right, perfectionism leaves you unhappy and dissatisfied with your achievements.
- Perfectionist feel good about themselves when they meet their high standards and bad they don’t. 
    - With self-compassion our sense of self-worth isn’t contingent on success or failure; it’s rooted in being a flawed human being doing the best we can in the moment.
- Acknowledge that sometimes, try as we might, we come up short.
- Perfectionism (never good enough) … can be interpreted as an effort to convince ourselves or others that we’re valuable and worthy.
