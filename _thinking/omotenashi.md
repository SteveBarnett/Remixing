A new word I discovered while reading [Things Become Other Things](https://craigmod.com/books/things_become_other_things/): Omotenashi. 

- Mindful, wholehearted, selfless, quiet, hospitality
    - Maybe “having no public face”, being transparent when serving
- Anticipating and fulfilling needs
- Surpassing expectations
- Meticulous attention to detail
- Reciprocal kindess and compassion

## Notes from a few places

- a Japanese expression that roughly describes concepts of hospitality as well as mindfulness. The term developed particularly around the roles of the host at a Japanese tea ceremony.
- a Japanese philosophy that governs hospitality and customer service interactions, among other things.
    - the above-and-beyond standards that Japanese hospitality is famous for.
    - omotenashi is a two-way deal: Reciprocate the kindness that you receive with respect and gratitude.
    - has a nuanced meaning that translates more precisely to conveying an authentic, genuine, and transparent image toward customers
    - wholehearted hospitality. This means:
        - Meticulous attention to detail.
        - Foreseeing the needs of others.
        - Selflessly surpassing expectations.
- “wholehearted hospitality”, “selfless service”
    - creating a comfortable and enjoyable experience for the guest without waiting for them to ask or expecting anything in return
    - quietly do something for your comfort and convenience
    - “Motenashi” would be an abbreviated expression referring to this much longer expression: モノを持って成し遂げる (read mono o motte nashi togeru). In English, this translates very loosely to something along the lines of “receive and serve with utmost compassion for your guest or customer”;
    - If we don’t assume that omotenashi uses a prefix, its closest kanji equivalent would be 表裏なし, which shares the same reading and translates to “having no public face.” In the present context, this would mean being completely transparent when serving or hosting.
    - 5 qualities we should all work towards:
        - Be intentional and careful;
        - Have the will to care for others;
        - Give importance to caring for others;
        - Our tools reflect our personalities, so be mindful of how you use and maintain them;
        - Keep in mind our actions also reflect our personalities.
- Taking pride in anticipating and fulfilling people’s needs in advance, the influence of omotenashi is everywhere in Japanese hospitality.
    - “Omote” means public face – an image you wish to present to outsiders. “Nashi” means nothing.
- to wholeheartedly look after guests
    - there are no menial tasks if the result ensures a great experience for a guest
