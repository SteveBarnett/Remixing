Conclusion from [Remixing gathering notes](#remixing-gathering-notes).

- The way out is acceptance of “not good enough”
- Using self-compassion, self-forgiveness, to turn avoid into approach
- Bringing attention to pain and unmet needs

Using the [mirror metta](/thinking/my-mirror-metta/) style to sneak around any resistance.

Actually, it's not so much that I'm a Perfectionist. I think I've loosened that slightly. However, I have kept the "this is not good enough" (whatever "this" is) part of Perfectionism. Which is not great.

## Tendencies

When I was thinking through [The People-Pleaser, The Perfectionist, The Critic](/thinking/self-compassion/) I whittled out (a bit) that my evaluation of any given situation is weighted towards classifying it as a failure and therefore classifying myself as a failure. 

This is, broadly speaking, because I have a tendency to:

- frame the target as a requirement for worthiness
- move the target value unrealistically high
- move the actual value lower than it really is
- think in binaries (true/false, success/failure).

## Remixing gathering notes

- "Not good enough" is a trap
- It's a rigged game
- It's an unsolvable riddle, like a koan
- The only way out is to play a different game, reject the terms, "[I would prefer not to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartleby,_the_Scrivener)"
    - Even recommitting to valued action can be evaluated, found lacking
- **The way out is acceptance of "not good enough"**
    - **Using self-compassion, self-forgiveness, to turn avoid into approach**
    - Using mistakes and troubles as signposts on the Path, not obstacles to the Way
    - **Bringing attention to pain and unmet needs**

## Gathered notes

- Perfectionism is a trap
- As humans, we’re imperfect, incomplete, unresolved.
    - But/and compassion lets us also see our wholeness and completeness.
- Don't try and be perfect, just keep recommitting to aligning your actions with [your values](/themes/2025/#valued-action-pock)
- Accept your imperfections to let them become signposts on the Path, not obstacles to the Way
    - Self-forgiveness mitigates negative affect, turns avoid into approach
- **Bring attention to the pain and unmet needs you have, that the Critic surfaces**
- When we learn to acknowledge, embrace, and understand of our suffering, we suffer much less
- Take care of all the parts of who you are

## Gathering notes

- Enneagram
    - Characteristic role: Perfectionist
    - Holy idea: Perfection. Trap: Perfection
    - Basic fear: being bad
    - Basic desire: integrity
    - Temptation: hypercriticism
    - Stress/Disintegration: Individualist
- Perfectionism seeks an exit from the human condition, not an exploration and enrichment of it.
- Things that happen, our imperfections, are signposts on the Path, not obstacles to the Way.
- **Accepting our imperfections lets them become part of the path rather than obstacles on the path.**
- Our imperfections are part of us, but they don’t define us.
    - Let go of the anxiety about your imperfections.
    - We just have patterns and conditioned identification (especially with our built-in negativity bias).
- Don’t try and fight, argue with, the inner critic. 
    - Self-blame, self-hatred, pushing away, creates a barrier.
    - **Bring attention to the pain and unmet needs that they are trying to help with.**
    - Mindfully recognise and bring compassion to the parts of our selves we’ve ignored, condemned, pushed away.
    - “What wants attention or acceptance right now?”
- Everything is perfect as it is, even the ego that insists it's not.
- Develop a healthy relationship with your imperfections.
- **Imperfections are normal, natural, human.**
- See the balanced view of yourself: your patterns and human imperfections; your basic innate goodness.
- **Not perfect, just engaged and committed to aligning actions with values.**
- Redundancy is more reliable than attempts at perfection.
- Aim for excellence over perfection.
- **As humans, we’re imperfect, incomplete, unresolved. But/and compassion lets us also see our wholeness and completeness.**
- **Self-forgiveness mitigates negative affect, turns avoid into approach.**
- **Every act carries some chance of mistake. When we proceed slowly we can learn from our mistakes.**
- Keep going. Begin again. Drop the story. Don’t get lost in shame, guilt, or self-hatred.
- Perfection isn’t a matter of not making any mistakes. It’s about the ability to learn from them, to get up and keep going, to not take mistakes personally or get lost in shame, guilt and self-hatred, to start fresh Here-Now.
- **Our shaky imperfection thickens the plot … the path of self-knowledge and self-authorship spirals up and down, backward and forward, plummets, rises and falls.**
- **When we learn to acknowledge, embrace, and understand of our suffering, we suffer much less.**
- **Meet life as it is, not as you want it to be, as it “should” be.**
- Slowly, painfully, reconcile to life.
- Sit still and feel the discomfort.
- When we stop running away and open to simply being here, the problem dissolves along with the “me” - who seemed to have it.
- Take care of all the parts of who you are.
