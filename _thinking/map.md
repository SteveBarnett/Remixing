The living version of several previous swirls.

A brief summary:

- The path is goal. Living a good enough, ordinary, life.
- My practice is meditation and mindfulness.
- I use layers as a way of finding concrete things to do. I like using the rule of threes.
- Reality is one, complex, empty, flow. It's free of concepts, language, characteristics.
- The infinite causes and conditions of Reality create everything.
- Our true nature is the (open, empty, luminous) context of consciousness.
- All matter is swirls of degrees of consciousness.
- The cosmos is purposeful, patterned, and playful. It's consciousness as a verb.

## Practice

An important part is that this is a stance. [A direction(ional heading), a vector, a posture](/thinking/direction-word-salad/).

- It's like a wide path. I work better with a path, with guidelines, with signposts. But it needs to have flexibility.
- It's approached iteratively. Subject to constant revision and updates, subject to new understanding and knowledge and feedback. It's tentative.
- It's contextual, rather than hierarchical. Use the stance, tool, approach that's the best fit, the most appropriate, the most skilful response. There's seldom a right or correct choice, but there are usually better and worse ones.

When meditating, I try to [just sit](/thinking/zen/the-just-in-just-sitting/), like Zen [Shikantaza](/thinking/zen/shikantaza/). There's a relaxed, open, but watchful quality to it. A bit like alertness, but not tense. A sort of mix of single-tasking and one-pointedness and commitment and focus.

When out and about, I have a few little practices.

- To notice my true nature, I look for at the **centre**, for myself at zero distance.
- To notice the nonduality of Reality, I look for the **edges**.
    - Alternate take: Notice how things **show up together**.
- To notice impermanence, I watch for the **changes**.
- When I feel stressed, I remind myself of [the three uhds](/thinking/the-three-uhds/).
- I remind myself that the path is goal.

[LSD](/thinking/lsd/): Listen, Slow your tempo, Doubt.

### The path

Living a good enough, ordinary, life.

- Take the path as the goal.
- Practice is enlightenment.
- A gradual, never-ending, actualisation, embodiment, and integration.
- Living more frequently, for longer periods, from Reality, direct experience, instead of concepts.
- Continued recommitment to aligning your actions with your values.
    - Use "grips" that are practical, pragmatic, feasible, workable.
    - (From [Notes section of Precepts remixing](/thinking/precepts-remixing/#notes)) Using Valued Action as a way to examine deeply who I am, and into my failures to live up to the values.
- Keeping things alive and fresh by changing them regularly (not necessarily frequently).
- Stick to simple rules.
- Build in redundancy.
- Focus more on avoiding things that don't work than on trying to find out what does.
- What's the stance you're taking? What direction are you going?
    - Notice: does this lead towards suffering or away?
    - Uncovering. Letting go.
    - Notice and relax the patterns and conditioned identification.

## Layers

Spheres, area. Distinctions, not division. Useful ways of getting a handle on things, not actually separate things. 

All is included, all is needed: both/and, not either/or. Considering and taking multiple perspectives and viewpoints to get something more truthful, because it's a more complete picture.

- Body, Mind, Spirit
- Personal, Professional, Practice
- Inner/Outer and Individual/Collective
- [Layers](/thinking/layers/), depths (layers: influences each other; are distinct, but not divided; offer changes in context, scale, extent; move at different paces; have fuzzy boundaries)
    - ride the waves, calm the waves, be the waves
    - psychology to philosophy
    - mind, body, spirit
    - outer to inner
    - shallow to deep
    - outer to inner
    - noise, sounds, silence
    - thoughts, thoughts as illusion, before thought
- Progressive path, direct path, pathless path

"(You are) the ocean, not the waves" is a perhaps a bit cheesy and overused now. But it is also very good and accurate and fruitful. So I'm using that here as: ride the waves, calm the waves, be the waves.

#### Ride the waves

Look around. Apply psychological and logical understanding.

Not rules to be good, but guides to examine deeply who we are.

- Do less, not do more.
- Just do what needs to be done. Free of goals or outcomes.
- Notice (the details of) the map you're using.
- Negative Capability: remain in doubt and uncertainty.
- Take the more integrated picture, multiple viewpoints at once.
- Listen for [The Avoidance Alarm](/thinking/the-avoidance-alarm/).
- Right speech: true, kind, helpful, contextually appropriate.
- Plain language: clear, concise, well-organised.
- Piggyblocking. Establish a new habit more easily by putting it between two existing habits.
- Ask yourself: "How would you advise a friend?"
- Use Implementation Intentions on Redirects. Catch a bad habits and redirect to: Meditation; [Philotation](/notes/philosophy/philosophical meditation.jpg); another activity.
- Use Negative visualisation to soften the stings.

#### Calm the waves

Look closer. Feel your way through the ups and downs of being an embodied human being.

- Treat the everyday as sacred.
- [Remember the three uhds](/thinking/the-three-uhds/). Let go of the shoulds. Let go of the coulds. Rest in the good(s).
- Try, and fail, to find the edges. (Reality is one)
- Watch as things arise and pass away. (Reality is in constant flux)
- Watch as things happen on their own. (The infinite causes and conditions of Reality create everything)
    - Notice the causes, conditions, and patterns.
- Remember that the map is not the territory. (Reality is complex, deep, rich)
    - Notice the fractal nature of everything.
- Look for what's static, fixed. (Reality is flow, motion, change)
    - Notice the motion, the changes. Watch it arise, watch it pass away.
- Notice the directionality, purposefulness, of things. (The cosmos is purposeful, patterned)
- Notice the playful nature of everything. There's exploring and realising, playing hide and seek. (The cosmos is playful)
- Leave things as they are, without adding a story or a label.
- “What wants attention or acceptance right now?” (from Trusting the Gold).
- <span id="signposts">Things that happen, our imperfections, are signposts on the Path, not obstacles to the Way.</span>
- Be generous, give generously.
- Work with what you find in the chaos of the world.

#### Be the waves

Look wider. Connect to a deeper sense of self.

This links with "[The cosmos is playful](#playful)" later in this page: the waves are a playful expression of the ocean. They waves aren't separate from the ocean. The ocean doesn't like small waves and dislike big waves (or vice versa).

- Notice the causes and conditions that lead to your suffering.
- Notice the causes, conditions, patterns that make you who you are.
- Look for source of an action, a decision, and notice the absence.
- Look for yourself, at zero distance. (The context of consciousness, not the contents)
    - Come back to the direct, embodied, experience.
    - Look for thinker of thoughts and notice the absence.
- Settle into an energetic balance, “between” two poles / opposites.
- Letting go of "this isn't it."
- Sit with koans to harness the energy of inquisitiveness and activate intuition.

## Theory

The nature of Reality, Consciousness, the cosmos.

### Reality

<div class="boxout">Reality is one, complex, empty, flow.</div>

- **Reality is one.**
    - There are distinctions, but not divisions.
        - A network of interdependence and mutual support.
        - Most things exist on a spectrum, not as a binary.
        - Things manifest as opposites, usually asymmetrical.
    - All forms are relational.
    - Things that are separate can't influence and act on each other.
    - The unity of Absolute and Relative, of emptiness and form.
        - <span id="why-cant-it-be-both">Why can't it be both?"</span>
        - Both/and instead of either/or.
- **Reality is complex, deep, rich.**
    - Concepts make forms, draw lines, build fences.
    - The closer you look, the more there is to see. Boredom is a failure to pay enough attention.
- **Reality is in constant flux and motion.**
    - Everything flows, changes, is impermanent.
    - "-ing"
        - Only the verb: no subject, no object.
        - Self as process.
- **Reality is free of concepts, language, characteristics.**
    - It’s empty of intrinsic, solid, stable, form(s), of boundaries.
    - Thinking, especially judging, creates separation, distance.
- **<span id="causes-and-conditions">The infinite causes and conditions of Reality create everything.</span>**
    - Including all our thoughts and actions.
        - But/and: we create our own reality.
            - Perception is participation, and creates different forms, depending on the scale.
    - **Things arise and pass away on their own.**
    - **Our thoughts, actions, bodies, are in and of Reality.**
        - When we are experience, there is no suffering. When we believe we're separate from it, there is suffering.
- **Concepts are many, simple, simple, full, static.**
    - In Zen, Reality and Concepts are called Absolute and Relative.
    - Our stance is both/and, not either/or.

### Consciousness

<div class="boxout">Our true nature is the (open, empty, luminous) context of consciousness. Everything is arising and passing away on its own.</div>

- **Our true nature, awareness, is the (open, empty, luminous) context of consciousness, not the contents.**
    - Anything that can be named or located can’t be you: it must an object in awareness or you couldn't be aware of it.
    - Subject and object arise as a pair in awareness.
    - The context is always bright, clear, boundless, whatever the contents of consciousness.
    - There’s no separate, solid, stable, self.
    - **Seen in the first instant.**
        - Before thoughts like classification, measuring, labelling.
        - It's close, not far away. It's on the surface, not deep down. 
    - **Always and already here**, but temporarily concealed.
- **All matter is swirls of degrees of consciousness.**
    - Like eddies in a river.
    - Life is consciousness that’s more concentrated.

### The cosmos

<div class="boxout">The cosmos is purposeful, patterned, and playful.</div>

- **The cosmos is purposeful, patterned.**
    - Value is intrinsic to Reality. Utility can’t explain beauty, truth, goodness.
    - But/and: only the verb is required. There's no separation of subject and object. There's no doer.
- **<span id="playful">The cosmos is playful.</span>**
    - There's exploring and realising, playing hide and seek.
- **The cosmos is consciousness as a verb.**
    - All matter is swirls of degrees of consciousness.
    - Life is consciousness that’s more concentrated.
    - Consciousness is the cosmos becoming more aware of itself.
