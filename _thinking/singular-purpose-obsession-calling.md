Thinking about style and substance, but more interested in what kind of hat it is than the colour, material, and so on.

I keep flipflopping about with this exercise, but I think what I was trying to get out of it was the name of the "job" that's My Thing. And it feels like comes down to trying to find a one-word-name for "[research, remix, replay](/thinking/my-pattern-skillset-research-remix-replay/)".

- I seek clarity. One big way I do that is Research, Remix, Replay.
- One of the main things I use it for (see, uh, **most of this site** üò≥, and [Themes in particular](/themes/2025/#valued-action-pock)) is Valued Action: being (more) clear on my values, how I am and aren't living up to them, and finding ways to align my actions with them.
- Being prosocial with it feels like a natural, obvious, implicit, part of that. Usually with a facilitator or friend hat on.

## Some gathered thoughts

Become more clear. Act with integrity, aligning your actions with your values. Help others do the same.

- less of a doer, more of an enabler "hey, here's a thing I found that might be useful" / "hmm, interesting, what do you mean, exactly?". But also a doer.
- puzzling this out is hard, feels like it must be a multi-class
- I keep coming back to values, to **Valued Action**, but that feels meta, not the thing
- To be able to say "I dedicated my life to the way of the X"
- Probably manifests as (asymmetrical) poles
- Something like **guide, trainer, coach, mentor**, keeps coming up
- Applied, practical, keeps coming up
    - Not solutions; approaches, paths, ideas
    - Not answers; more, hopefully helpful, questions
- Iterative, ongoing, improvements
- Pursuing wisdom, for myself and others. **Seeking and sharing wisdom.**
- Analysis, finding the core of something.
    - This is the what, the how, not the why
- Research, remix, replay. The remixing, recombining, feels core. You can't remix without the research.
    - The deep research is a bit of a result from how my brain works.
    - The remixing is a bit of a result from how I like to be creative.
    - The remix is a bit of a result from how I like to be practical: there must be an end result, a tangible outcome
- Hmm. Maybe it's (to copy from / match up with work stuff) **becoming more human-centred**.
- **Clear**, clarity, keeps coming up. **Seeing, thinking, more clearly.**
- Consistency. Logic. Rationality. **Integrity.**
- Testing, retesting
- **Questioning**, to clarify, to improve
- Signpost-maker, map-maker, enabler, **facilitator**, even supporter. But... why? What for?
- Assistant, helper
- Cut the Gordian knot. Not quite making complex things simple. More like being more clear on what's really important. **Value clarity.**
- Spot the difference.
- Justice. What's the right thing to do? What would the best version of you do?

### Questions to tease out the hat

- What do I do with good friends?
- What do I do here and on the work site?
- What do I do at work?
