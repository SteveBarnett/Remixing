Thinking about style and substance, but more interested in what kind of hat it is than the colour, material, and so on.

### Questions to tease out the hat

- What do I do with good friends?
- What do I do here and on the work site?
- What do I do at work?

## Bullet hell

There are lots of hats here. What I'd like to find is root one. The one that others are flavours of, remixes of, styles of.

- support, **maintenance**, **upkeep**, admin
- untangle knots, dissolver
- whittler, smoother
- research, remix, replay
- poker, constable
- empiricist, **scientist**, experimenter, tinkerer, tester, validator
- 2nd order thinker, helping people so that they can help people, **indirect**
- student, **nerd**, academic, **learner**, **researcher**
- pragmatic, practical
- being a human search engine that's **connected** the dots
- pattern-matcher
- framework builder
- attentive, small detail noticer
- sensitive
- asking questions, guiding, advising, reflecting
- widener, broadener, contextualiser, integrator
- being the opposite
- **explorer**, **ranger**
- map-maker, **guidebook writer**, note-leaver, field guider (from the desk, guy in the chair), signpost-maker
- examiner, socratic questioner, sceptic
- **organiser**, sorter, filterer, **tidier**, categoriser
- **clarifier**, focuser
- bringing it back to the human
- janitor, quartermaster
- editor, refiner, iterator

## Some digging from Socrates and friends

- Help people develop their understanding
- Question to determine consistency and coherence
- Question to bring everyone closer to the truth
- "The unexamined life is not worth living"
- cross-examining, testing, scrutiny
- Iterative process. Question, refine, question again.
- Acknowledging the role a person's causes and conditions determine their judgments, opinions, their idea of truth

## Support word salad

- support, help
- under, yielding, underneath
- behind the scenes, background
- janitor, quartermaster
- advisor, reflector

## My pattern / skillset

- Research. Take notes along the way. Look widely, look deeply.
- Remix. Note highlights, themes, big ideas. Group and shift similar ideas.
- Replay. Write up in a structured format. 

## The Constable

- detective, investigator
- “I have questions”
- ask questions, poke, sceptical

## Naga home page

- inclusive design and accessibility
- be empathetic; make it simple; be positive
- supporting, teaching / training, writing, presenting, and coding

## Naga about page

- human-centred front-end developer and user experience designer
- helps software teams have happier customers and make better software by becoming more human-centred
- helping people learn new things, or get better at things they already known
- building things for the web professionally since 2005 (and built things for fun for a while before that)

## sb.me MAP

- Think more broadly
- Why can't it be both?
- There's a lot going on there...
- Take the more integrated picture, multiple viewpoints at once

## Other hats

- Scientist, Empiricist, Pragmatist
