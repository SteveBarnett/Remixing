Notes from [Awakening your Everyday Bodhisattva](https://mmtcp.soundstrue.com/bodhisattva/) with Tara Brach, Jack Kornfield, and special guest teacher Reggie Hubbard.

- **The kindness you express to each being in your life.**
- Everyday kindness is the expression of spiritual awakening.
- **Taking away the barriers to love.**
- Scan your life for relationships for where you're habituated to distance.
- **It's part of our intrinsic nature to awaken to greater belonging.**

1. The grounds of loving-kindess
    - See the goodness.
    - "To love someone is to sing them the song in their heart when they've forgotten it."
    - **We need to tell people, remind them of their goodness.**
2. The grounds of compassion.
    - See vulnerability.
    - "We need a strong back and a soft front."

- Turn towards the peaceful heart of the Bodhisattva.
- **A community where we uplift each other.**
- **Set the compass of your heart towards compassion and care, no matter what.**
- Equanimity is not indifference.
- **The secret is not to be attached to the results.**
    - The value, the rightness, the truth of the work itself.
- Fierce open-heartedness
- The qualities that arise from practice keep us on the path.
- You're not called to do everything. You're called to do your thing.
- Serve the moments that pass before you with full presence.
- **Treat your difficulties as teachers.**
- **Bring some kindness and forgiveness to yourself.**
