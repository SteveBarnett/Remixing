For the first walking meditation of the retreat, we'll do some light guidance inside. You're welcome to go outside instead, or to stay inside and just use the sound of my voice as another object of meditation.

## Raw notes

Some scribbled notes from walking sessions on the Waking Up app.

- Find a good spot to practice: where you can walk forward for about 10 steps without bumping into anything
    - Just a few metres
- Take a moment to feel your body standing there. Tall, strong, back, neck and shoulders relaxed, arms hanging down.
- Pay attention to the feelings in your feet
    - The bottoms of your feet touching the floor
    - The weight of your feet on the floor
    - Your legs holding you up
- Tilt your head down very slightly and focus a little ways in front of you
- Walk very slowly
- Feel each part of your foot as you place it down gently
- The heel, the middle, the ball, the toes
- When you turn around, you might like to pause for a moment
    - take a few deep breaths, before starting walking slowly again
    - pay extra attention to the first step. like it's the first step.
- When you notice that your mind has wandered, you've been lost in thought: no problem. Just begin again
- Notice how your body shifts, how your weight shifts, even before you lift your foot
- Notice how your experience never starts changing

- Can be just as "good" as sitting, but can take a while to get into
- You can be as mindful when walking as you can sitting
- Not "going for a walk", but slow walking, meditation
- Can be super slow, taking minutes to reach the other side of the room
- The sensations of lifting, moving, placing your foot
- Walking very slowly back and forth
- If you find labels useful while meditating, you might like to use "lifting, moving, placing" for walking
- See if you can notice all the sensations there are
- Just receive the sensations. You don't need to pull at them.
- Notice the boundaries, the edges
    - When does lifting become moving?
    - When does moving become placing?
- Come back to the feeling of walking
    - The lifting, moving, placing, of each foot
    - Temperature, tingling, pressure, movement, air on your skin, weight shifting
- See if you drop the idea of the shape of feet, your legs
    - Just concentrate of the raw sensations you feel

### [Walking with Sensory Awareness - Mark Coleman](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/course/CODD12C?code=SC541514D&share_id=149D5DC7&source=content%20share)

- Noticing the quality and texture of the floor under your feet
- Notice the muscles of your body moving and tensing and relaxing
- Notice what your attention is drawn to
    - Sights, sounds, feelings
- Take in the details. Notice the colours, shapes, patterns of the floor
- When you notice you've been lost in thought, just put the thought down, let it go, relax into just the sensations without the story

### [Walking Meditation 2 - Sam Harris](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/course/C5C571?code=SC541514D&share_id=F1E1F8DD&source=content%20share)

- Walk as slowly as you like
- Pay careful attention to sensations in your feet, legs, body
- When you notice you've been lost in thought, just notice the next body sensation, arising on its own
- There's no need to try and feel the sensations, just let them appear, and notice them
- In the final minutes of the session, focus as closely as possible on the sensations in your feet
