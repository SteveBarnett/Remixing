## Notes from notes

### Observations

- Culture, parents, often communicate that to be loved and approved we need to look and act a certain way.
    - We sense we're intrinsically flawed. We worry others will find out.
    - The Western creation myth says: I am bad, I am falling short, I am wrong.
        - This conditioning goes deep.
- All beings have a negativity bias for survival, but humans make it a problem by identifying with it.
    - We tend to get down on ourselves about our conditionings.
        - It's not personal.
- Not "bad self", but patterns, conditioned identification.
- Self-blame and self-hatred divides us from ourself. Self-forgiving reconnects us.
    - Pushing away creates a barrier.
    - Trying to hide feelings deepens our separation from others.

### Guidance

- Bring attention to the judge and the judged.
    - Notice what your strategy is to deal with pain.
- It doesn't help to fight the judge. Ask: how are you trying to help?
    - Have an inner coach instead of inner critic.
    - Let go of the anxiety about your imperfections.
    - Check if judging yourself works. (Spoilers: it doesn't!)
    - Our bad behaviours come from unmet needs.
- Accept life, just as it is.
    - Whatever we can't embrace with love imprisons us.
- Mindfully recognise and bring compassion to the parts of our being we've ignored, condemned, pushed away.
- We're not defined by our imperfections.
    - They're part of us.
    - They're learned patterns of behaviours.
- Ask: who would you be if you didn't believe there was something wrong with you?

### Actions

- RAIN. If you struggle one of the steps of RAIN, slow down.
    - Express the "I" of RAIN with your face and posture.
- Meet your edge and soften.
- Pause and ask "What am I believing?"
- Ask yourself "What would be enough?"
- Further inquire "What wants attention or acceptance right now?"
