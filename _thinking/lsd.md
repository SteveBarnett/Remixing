**L**isten, **S**low down, **D**oubt.

I was thinking about [RAIN](/thinking/wider-rain-practice/) and [SNAIW](/thinking/revisiting-rest/#snaiw-) and [Slow, Accept, Open](/thinking/revisiting-rest/#slow-accept-open) and things, and about tweaking the wording to make it a better fit for me.

I was looking for phrasing that helped me stay the course more, restricted me a bit more.

I whittled down to

- Listen. This feels a little tighter. With watch or notice, there's still an element of action. We can still choose what to notice, where to look, to some degree. Listening feels more aligned with acceptance, to noticing without judgement.
- Slow down. Impermanence sometimes makes me feel like stillness isn't really possible. Life is movement. For now, slow down feels more useful to me than (perhaps the more true) "movement happens in stillness". Patience. It feels like this aligns well with listening too: you can't stop listening, but you can listen more carefully, more closely.
- Doubt. I find this good for widening, opening, don't-know-ing, questioning, curiosity.
