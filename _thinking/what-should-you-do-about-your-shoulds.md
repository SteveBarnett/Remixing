- There's no escape from "should"s
    - Humans are social, so we have a moral compass
    - Good/bad, right/wrong are "should"s
- Most of our "should" problems come from (rigid, narrow, closed) top-down shoulds
- Bottom-up shoulds are more healthy
    - They inviting the good within to become manifest
    - They enable the natural movement of your innate goodness

- Meditation
    - Strengthen the mind, attention
    - rest the mind (on what matters to you)
- **there's no escape from values**
    - (preferring one end of a polarity to the other)
- use anger, don't let it use you
- good/bad, right/wrong is about shoulds
- we "should" at others, at ourselves
- wise ways of relating to shoulds, noticing what creates suffering
- humans are social by nature, so we have a built-in moral compass
- two fundamental sources: top-down shoulds and bottom-up shoulds

## top-down shoulds

- executive, language-based standards   
- reminders to self
- rules, shame, pressure, angry at yourself for falling short
- rigid, narrow
- some pitfalls. **Most of our "should" problems come from top-down shoulds.**

## bottom-up shoulds

- wider picture, taking more into account, see many causes and conditions
- assumes innate goodness
- always has compassion, **inviting the good within to become manifest**
- "doing the best you can" - bit loaded, but can be useful in reorienting to bottom up, in self-forgiveness for motivation
- **the natural movement of your innate goodness**
