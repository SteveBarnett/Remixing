Avoidance is a common reaction to aversion. Suppression and acting out can both be ways of avoiding negative feelings.

Avoidance just makes matters worse.

- The negative feelings don't go away
- We never see what's on the other side of the pain
- It's denying this aliveness, which contains suffering

Instead of avoiding:

- Open yourself to the discomfort completely
- Respond with compassion
- Respond with self-forgiveness to turn avoid into approach
- Be curious, friendly, patient
- Look deeply into it to understand it

## Gathered notes

- The most common reaction to aversion is avoidance. We hope to avoid negative feelings, or make them go away, but it doesn't work.
- If you try to avoid something, it’s still affecting you.
- After you’ve built up more tolerance for Life and made peace with many of the things that have previously led you toward resistance, denial, and avoidance, the biggest obstacle to Mindfulness is your belief that whatever is currently happening is not worth paying full attention to.
- Measuring progress is a great way to avoid being present here and now.
- When facing unpleasant experiences, whether the source is internal or external, responding with compassion invites us to stop avoiding what we feel.
- Instead of trying to avoid the discomfort, open yourself completely to it
- Chasing comfort makes us avoid pain: we never see what's on the other side
- Using meditation or mindfulness to try and avoid or get rid of feelings is just another form of resistance.
- Self-forgiveness mitigates negative affect, turns avoid into approach.
- Trying to avoid or escape suffering just makes matters worse.
- Suffering is part of this aliveness. Efforts to avoid suffering or escape from suffering are a denial of this aliveness.
- Suppressing anger is a way of avoiding getting to know it. But so is acting it out.
- We avoid facing our real life, because it hurts.
- We have to live out our own lives, and we have to learn to encounter whatever comes up without avoiding difficulties. This is the spirit of magnanimity which Dōgen Zenji has referred to as daishin, or Big Mind.
- The way of the true Buddhist is through the world, not avoiding its difficulties, not plunging into oblivion in the absolute.
- Continuing to recycle the old story line is a way of avoiding fundamental ambiguity
- We run away from suffering, we're nudged into doing by grasping and resisting.
- When these don't match with what our culture, our parents, our friends tell us are acceptable, loveable, worthy, we run away from that discomfort.
- Don’t run away, analyse it, think about it. Just rest with it, be curious, friendly, patient.
- We do not run away from suffering, instead we embrace it, and look deeply into our suffering to understand it. With insight comes transformation and healing.
- We fear being overwhelmed by our suffering, despair, anger, and loneliness, so we run away.
