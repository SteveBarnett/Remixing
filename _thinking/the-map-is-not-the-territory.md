- There's a difference between the model / abstraction / perception / map and the reality / territory.
- Maps can be: out of date; incorrect; biased, interpreted; missing important information; inaccurate.
- We need abstractions (simplifications, generalisations), to understand reality. It's too complex otherwise! 
- We need to maintain critical awareness of the map's limitations.

## Raw notes

- The map-territory mental model is about understanding the difference between perceptions (the ‘map’) and the actual reality (the ‘territory’).
- just like a map can be outdated or incomplete, our beliefs might not always match the real world exactly.
- `maps` ... are reductions of what they represent. If a map were to represent the territory with perfect fidelity, it would no longer be a reduction and thus would no longer be useful to us.
- A map can also be a snapshot of a point in time, representing something that no longer exists. 
- the description of the thing is not the thing itself. The model is not reality.
- The only way we can process the complexity of reality is through abstraction.
- Korzybski gives us a few to explore:
	- The map could be incorrect without us realizing it;
	- The map is, by necessity, a reduction of the actual thing, a process in which you lose certain important information;
	- A map needs interpretation, a process that can cause major errors.
- See also: "All models are wrong but some are useful." - George Box.
	- This emphasizes the proper framing of recognizing map–territory differences
	- The point is not that all maps are useless; rather, the point is simply to maintain critical thinking about the discrepancies: whether or not they are either negligible or significant in each context, how to reduce them (thus iterating a map, or any other model, to become a better version of itself), and so on.
- The model is not the data
- Alan Watts's "The menu is not the meal."
- René Magritte illustrated the concept of "perception always intercedes between reality and ourselves" in a number of paintings such as The Treachery of Images, which consists of a drawing of a pipe with the caption, "Ceci n'est pas une pipe".
- Esoteric concepts are those which cannot be fully conveyed except by direct experience. For example, a person who has never tasted an apple will never fully understand through language what the taste of an apple is without actually eating an apple. 
- “The Map Is Not the Territory” emphasizes the distinction between perception and reality, promoting critical thinking.
- Maps, both literal and metaphorical, are imperfect representations and subject to potential limitations.
- Recognizing the discrepancies between our mental models and reality can enhance decision-making, communication, and empathy.
- To better understand maps as representations, consider these key points:
	- **Maps are simplifications:** Due to their inherently abstract nature, maps condense and simplify complex information. They cannot capture every detail of a territory; instead, they prioritize specific features or purposes.
	- **Accuracy is relative:** An accurate map may be precise in some aspects but not in others. For instance, a map whose primary focus is on political divisions may disregard geographical information.
	- **Different maps, different perspectives:** Various maps offer unique perspectives and interpretations of a territory. A single region can be portrayed differently in physical, political, or thematic maps.
- Some common types of abstractions include:
	- **Generalizations:** Grouping similar objects, situations, or concepts under a broader category to reduce complexity.
	- **Simplifications:** Streamlining complex information or systems by focusing on key elements and discarding less crucial details.
	- **Analogies:** Comparing unfamiliar concepts or situations with familiar ones to establish a better understanding.
