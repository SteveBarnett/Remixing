- Update and run [The Headless Way](/thinking/the-headless-way-session-for-one-mindful-breath/).
- Mindfulness and conflict. Pull together [The Zen of You and Me: conflict](/thinking/the-zen-of-you-and-me-conflict/), [Argument and Conflict](/thinking/argument-and-conflict/), and [Compassion and conflict](/thinking/compassion-and-conflict/). Maybe the [conflict section of my notes](/notes/#conflict) too.
- Tao Te Ching. A few ideas from my favourite book.
- A few fruitful ideas from Zen. Expand on [Notes from six months of studying and practicing Zen](/thinking/zen/notes-from-six-months-of-studying-and-practicing-zen/).
- The Matter With Things. Some notes from the book. Maybe some bits of [My (applied) philosophy](/thinking/my-applied-philosophy/), and how that overlaps with Buddhism.
- Best bits from Beck books. [Everyday Zen](/notes/zen/everyday%20zen%20-%20charlotte%20joko%20beck.jpg), [Nothing Special](/notes/zen/nothing%20special%20-%20charlotte%20joko%20beck.jpg).
- Wu wei. Being, not doing. Example: just sitting.
