## Highlights

> Our essential nature [is] an unconditional 'Yes' to all experience just as it is from moment to moment, without judgement or preference.<br>—Rupert Spira

Awareness is always saying 'yes' to everything without exception.

When we take up saying 'Yes' to everything as a kind of practice—or I'd prefer to say playful exploration—we very quickly realize how often we are saying 'No' to what is showing up.

We begin to see and feel how this 'no' is a thought accompanied by a bodily contraction, and how this thought is always rooted in protecting or defending 'me' or something I identify with, such as my tribe or my opinions.

This 'no' comes from and reinforces the thought-sense of separation and encapsulation. It's about judging, resisting, pushing away, demonizing or othering something or someone.

The 'yes,' on the other hand, is the natural action of open, unbound awareness. Awareness is always allowing everything to be just as it is. ... In the absence of that contracted me-sense, we meet everything with openness, with unconditional love, knowing it as our own being. We respond intelligently rather than reacting from conditioned habit.

Of course, as we soon discover, the thinking mind, posing as me, cannot simply force a 'no' to turn into a 'yes' through will-power. The very effort to do so is itself a 'no' to the original 'no.' It gets very subtle. ... All that can really happen is seeing the 'no,' being aware of it, seeing it from awareness, which means seeing it without resistance or judgment. 

... because remaining with the simplicity of "just this" goes against all our habitual conditioning, this exploration of present experiencing does at times require a certain amount of effort. But paradoxically, it is an effortless kind of effort, a relaxed effort, a playful effort.

One of the things I appreciate about Zen is that it avoids landing on any fixed or one-sided view about any conceptual duality ... Zen doesn't land on either extreme. ... Zen suggests that reality is “not one, not two.” It can't be grasped by any concept.
