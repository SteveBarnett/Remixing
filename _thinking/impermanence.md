### What is it?

- Reality is a single flow. Nothing really forms long enough to be an impermanent thing.
- A person is different in different situations. Someone who's a parent is (still themselves, but is) a different person when they're around their children and when they're around their own parents.
- A person changes over time. Perhaps someone is very similar to how they were a year ago. But what about five years ago? Ten years ago? Twenty? More?

### Why is it important?

Accepting that flux and insecurity are the norm brings peace. Trying to stop things from changing only brings misery: we will always fail, eventually. It helps to realise that life is about navigating and using the tides and currents, the growth and decay, not fighting against them.

It can help to **think in bets**: decisions are bets on the future. The outcome of every decision is a mix of the quality of your decision and luck. Realising and admitting the role of luck in life softens the bad outcomes and helps us be more humble about the good outcomes.
