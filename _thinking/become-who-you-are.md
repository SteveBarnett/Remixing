Nietzsche famously said "become who you are." Much of the Buddhist stuff I read talks about accepting who you are, being who you are.

- Cultivate bravery and flexibility
- Accept the uncertainty and instability of life that comes from impermanence
- Learn to let go, relax into the moment, and notice things arise and pass away
- Use self-compassion and self-forgiveness to turn avoid into approach
- Experiment and tinker: take lots of small risks and make small mistakes

## Bits from notes

Looking at the intersection of playfulness, openness, avoidance, risk tolerance, safety, uncertainty, unexpectedness, surprise.

### Uncertainty

- Impermanence is necessary for life and growth
    - But it brings uncertainty and unpredictability
- Negative Capability: remain in doubt and uncertainty
- Accept uncertainty and incorporate it into life
   - Hold no expectations
- Cultivate courage and flexibility to live with uncertainty
- When we refrain from speaking or acting out, we’re allowing ourselves to feel the underlying uncertainty—that edgy, restless energy—without trying to escape
- Uncertainty is just a story you tell yourself. (Inaction is in fact an action)

### Unexpectedness

- Go by unexpected ways.
- There are many kinds of agitation. One is a feeling of danger, a second is a feeling that something is beyond your capability, and a third is a feeling of the unexpected
- No matter how many techniques we learn, life will always be full of unexpected twists and turns.
- Treat waiting as unexpected extra time to practice.

### Surprise

- Be open to being surprised
- It’s surprising how many things do become more appetising once you’re encountering them not as chores you have to plough through, but as options you get to pick.
- Don’t-know mind is one characterized by curiosity, surprise, and wonder. It is receptive, ready to meet whatever shows up as it is.
- (I tend to have varying levels of aversion to change and surprises)

### Safety

- Learn to let go and relax into the moment. Your interest in being right, safe, under control begins to fall away.
- We think that being human is a problem we can solve, but we can't find security, stability, safety
- The ideal balance for self-compassion practice is to feel challenged but to explore just a bit beyond your comfort zone.
- Have a safe, nutritious, space in meditation. Somewhere that arises with ease, is stabilising, comforting.
- When meditating, notice part of your body that feels at ease, solid, safe, stable, pleasant.
- When our attention narrows in conflict, we find ourselves trapped in the one perspective that makes us feel the safest: “I’m right and you’re wrong.”
- Try softer, not harder—<br>giving yourself a safe place<br>to land your attention, resting<br>in this threshold moment

### Risk

- Experiment and tinker: take lots of small risks
- Avoid SPOFs
- What's the actual, not perceived risk? Likelihood x Impact.
- Be willing to take risks and make mistakes. We begin to develop a love for the flavour of difference and its enlivening and disrupting impact.
- Notice the risks/rewards of neglecting/focusing on each pole.

### Avoidance

- The most common reaction to aversion is avoidance
    - By avoiding we hope to avoid negative feelings, or make them go away, but it doesn't work
    - Unskillful behaviour can result in difficulties when pain can't be avoided
- When facing unpleasant experiences, whether the source is internal or external, responding with compassion invites us to stop avoiding what we feel.
- (Historically, I have tended towards an [Avoidant Attachment style](/thinking/avoidant-attachment-style), in particular avoiding vulnerability)
    - (See also: [Avoiding Avoidance](/thinking/avoiding-avoidance))
- See also: [In the mess of it](/thinking/in-the-mess-of-it/)
- Relax and open yourself to discomfort instead of trying to avoid it
    - Notice how it's part of a larger whole
    - Your interest in being comfortable begins to fall away
- Using self-compassion, self-forgiveness, to turn avoid into approach
- Give up the struggle. Stop limiting, denying, avoiding your experience. Stop discriminating against what belongs in awareness and what doesn't.
