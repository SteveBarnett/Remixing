Restorer and improver. But also troublemaker. And perfectionist.

## Reformer

Another twist on [Perfectionist from Enneagram characteristics](/thinking/enneagram-characteristics/#an-example).

- Inciter, dissident, fighter, heretic, rebel, **troublemaker**.
- Agitator, renegade.

## Reform

- Correct, rectify, amend, **improve**, rebuild, remake, **restore**, rework.
