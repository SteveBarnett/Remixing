<div class="boxout">When I notice that I'm avoiding something, in particular avoiding investigating the "why", that's an alarm bell.</div>

I've know for some time that I have an avoidant attachment style (sometimes called anxious-avoidant, which is also accurate). I'm particularly avoidant of conflict. Some of the things that are classically avoidant that I recognise:

- valuing independence;
- struggling with feeling and expressing emotions and needs;
- physical and emotional withdrawal, especially during conflict.

These days these things aren't so bad, or come out so... vigorously. But they're still there.

A core part of my make-up is that I like to ask questions, figure out why, get to the root of things. Tools / practices like [philosophical meditation](/notes/philosophy/philosophical%20meditation.jpg) are a good match for how I approach the world. A minor in Questioner, in [The Four Tendencies](/notes/systems-thinking/the%20four%20tendencies.jpg) language. Even conflict, which I find very scary, I try and approach with this detective hat on: see [Compassion and conflict](/thinking/compassion-and-conflict/), [Argument and Conflict](/thinking/argument-and-conflict/). Related: [The Constable](/thinking/the-constable/).

So, when I notice that I'm avoiding something, that's an alarm bell for me. In particular, if I'm avoiding looking at the "why" for something, that's a loud alarm bell. My general approach is to ask questions and poke at things. Perhaps it's a sore spot, so the poking needs to be more gentle. But the alarm bell is sounding and it says "Hey, look over here! Even though you don't want to."
