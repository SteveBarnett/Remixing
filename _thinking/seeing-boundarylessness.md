Boundlessness? Limitlessness? It feels like it's not quite the same as infinity.

An idea / experience that comes up a lot if various traditions in something like "Your true nature is boundless, open, space." Related: empty, formless.

While listening to some more Headless Way sessions, I stumbled across what feels like an "easy" and obvious way of accessing this feeling of boundarylessness. It's a bit thinking and a bit experiencing. It's basically taking the field of vision experiment and expanding it outwards.

- Notice something in your field of the vision.
- Look for the edges.
    - Notice how you can tell it's the edge because you can see what's past the edge. You can see the "next" thing.
- Notice your field of vision.
- Look for the edge, the boundary.
    - Apply some relaxed, low effort, to finding the edge.
        - What do you actually experience?  
            - Not what you know. What you experience, before labelling it or judging it.
            - Not what it means. Just what is is, just what is given.
            - Not what others say. What you find when you check for yourself.
    - If you think you can see the edge, what's past it? What's the "next" thing?
- Everything you can perceive appears in your field of perception.
- Can you see anything that's not in your field of vision?
- Your feel of vision is boundless, open, space.

My initial thought was that I was looking for a good way to demonstrate this to others, help them see it too. But perhaps it's just me finally "getting", experientially, [The Pointing Experiment](/thinking/the-headless-way-session-for-one-mindful-breath/#-pointing-experiment).

Some Headless Way notes of mine: [The Headless Way](/thinking/headless/); [Experiments in Having No Head](/thinking/experiments-in-having-no-head/); ["The Headless Way" session for One Mindful Breath](/thinking/the-headless-way-session-for-one-mindful-breath/) (which I continue to chicken out of running); [The Headless Way: A Conversation](/thinking/the-headless-way-a-conversation/).
