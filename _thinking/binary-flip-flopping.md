I find it hard to hold opposites together, to sit in and with the larger space that holds both. I tend to flip-flop between the two poles instead, often energetically. Less like a pendulum swinging and more like a coin flipping.

I think my path through it is to hold the concepts of the two poles more lightly and notice how Reality, experience, does both. Give up the fight of conceptualising the poles. Stop confusing the finger pointing at the moon for the moon.

The coin flipping seems to be happening, but it's an illusion.

## Binaries

- I have a perhaps [trait](/thinking/traits/)-based tendency towards thinking in binaries. Especially when I'm stressed or tired. So either something is a success or a failure with no middle ground.
- I know this is not how the world really is. In fact, I often also resist extremes and absolutes. Especially things like always / never or 0% / 100%. I appreciate complexity and nuance, even though (maybe because) I struggle with it.
- I know binaries are often not fruitful. Binaries can lead to guilt, shame, and acting out. Binary thinking can lead to us vs them, othering, violence.

## Polarities

- Things do manifest in poles, though.
- I keep coming back to a bar magnet as an analogy. It's one thing. The magnetic force is a field, not a clean cut. But it does have positively charged end and a negatively charged end, and they are not the same.

## Both/and

- Some advice talks about finding the middle way. Sometimes that can't be done. Sometimes the thing to look at is the (larger) space that contains both. A both/and, not an either/or.
- Fighting and resisting the two opposite pulls / poles, trying to satisfy both, or trying to land in the middle is exhausting. And my energy levels are low. See [potato](/thinking/potato/).
- What we need is a more nuanced, broader, middle way that's more like "why can't it be both?", and "when and how does this apply?", and "what are the ranges on the spectrum?"

## From not to non

- Looking at Buddhist precepts and nondual ideas feels like it has something here.
- One of the precepts is about not stealing, not taking what is not given. There are more positive, aspirational, phrasings of this like being satisfied with what we have, or giving freely and being generous.
- But I really like this take: "From not to non: both stealing and not stealing have been liberated to become non-stealing." (from [Nancy Mujo Baker's Opening to Oneness (A Practical and Philosophical Guide to the Zen Precepts)](/thinking/zen/opening-to-oneness/)). It tastes different to 'the bigger space of stealing and not stealing.'
- And from ["Death: The End of Self-Improvement" by Joan Tollifson](/thinking/notes-from-death-the-end-of-self-improvement-by-joan-tollifson/)
    - "We canâ€™t land on either free will or no free will because both are conceptual abstractions of a living reality that cannot be captured in any conceptual formulation."
    - "Genuine transformation recognizes the inseparability and collaborative necessity of both apparently opposing forces."
- So it's not quite true to say that things manifest in poles. Reality appears as one thing, and we map the poles on to it.
