Some recent reading and listening are (re)bringing home to me the importance of acceptance. In particular, **the importance of accepting pain** (at the time of writing for me, painful situation(s)). For me, non-acceptance usually takes the form of [avoidance](/thinking/the-avoidance-alarm/).

## Sensitivity dial

An idea I picked up from somewhere in my Daoist reading (possibly an Alan Watts book) is that as humans we only have one sensitivity dial. We can make ourselves less sensitive to pain, but that means less sensitive to pleasure too. If we let ourselves feel the pleasurable things in life more intensely, we'll also feel the painful things more intensely.

[Avoidance](/thinking/the-avoidance-alarm/) pain is a form of aversion. Seeking distractions, pushing away. While avoidance is there strongly, I find it difficult (perhaps impossible) to get to the [open, empty, luminous context of consciousness](/thinking/map/#consciousness). It's like (to keep with the watery metaphor from the [layers in the MAP](/thinking/map/#layers)) I'm dragging an anchor around. 

## Acceptance before Awakening

Awakening in the sense of: temporary cessation, being the context of consciousness.

I was very drawn to [Easing the Nervous System by Kelly Boys](/thinking/easing-the-nervous-system-by-kelly-boys/) on the Waking Up app. I've found Kelly Boys' other series and sessions good, but this one one really hit home hard. That and the [Pain Without Suffering series on Waking Up](/thinking/pain-without-suffering-series-on-waking-up/) series are bringing home for me the foundational importance of acceptance.

- Noticing the context of consciousness ([being the waves in the MAP](/thinking/map/#be-the-waves)) comes after noticing, working with, and accepting the opposite.
- Noticing and working with the opposite comes after noticing, working with, and accepting the initial experience.

**Noticing the context of consciousness comes after accepting this and not-this.** As in: it's always possible to connect with it, but it can be or feel, much more difficult without acceptance.

### Sudden and Gradual

The Direct Path (including Zen) suggests that it's possible to connect quickly and deeply with the context of consciousness. But I'm finding that very difficult at the moment. And although they say this experience is sudden, it's also gradual. [Why can't it be both?](/thinking/map/#why-cant-it-be-both) It can. It is. Both/and.

From [Sitting with Koans](/thinking/zen/sitting-with-koans/#direct-and-gradual): 

> The leap from the hundred-foot-pole (from the conditioned to the unconditioned) is immediate, sudden. But it takes time to build up the courage to jump.

With practice, the courage for each jump tends to take less and less time to build up.
