## The Flip

To be something, you must first be its opposite. This prepares the path.

No-thing remains itself.

- To be whole, first be broken.
- Keep empty and you will be filled.
- Wear out to be renewed.

### 22. Growing Downward (UKLG)

Be broken to be whole.<br>
Twist to be straight.<br>
Be empty to be full.<br>
Wear out to be renewed.<br>
Have little and gain much.<br>
Have much and get confused.

### 22 (JCHW)

Bend and you will be whole.<br>
Curl and you will be straight.<br>
Keep empty and you will be filled.<br>
Grow old and you will be renewed.

### XXII (DCL)

Bowed down the preserved;<br>
Bent then straight;<br>
Hollow then full;<br>
Worn then new;<br>
...

### 22. Celebrate Paradox! (RAD)

No-thing remains itself.<br>
Each prepares the path to its opposite.<br>
<br>
To be ready for wholeness, first be fragmented.<br>
To be ready for rightness, first be wronged.<br>
To be ready for fullness, first be empty.<br>
To be ready for renewal, first be worn out.<br>
To be ready for success, first fail.<br>
To be ready for doubt, first be certain.

### 22. Soften To Know (RG)

Soften to know. Bend to understand. Empty to fill. Ideals create confusion. The great the certainty, the less the understanding.

### 36. The Small Dark Light (UKLG)

What seeks to shrink<br>
must first have grown;<br>
what seeks weakness<br>
surely was strong.<br>
What seeks its ruin<br>
must first have risen;<br>
what seeks to take<br>
has surely given.<br>
<br>
This is called the samll dark light:<br>
the soft, the weak prevail<br>
over the hard, the strong.

### 36 (JCHW)

What is in the end to be shrunken,<br>
Begins by being first stretched out.<br>
What is in the end to be weakened,<br>
Begins by being first made strong.<br>
What is in the end to be thrown down,<br>
Begins first by being set on high.<br>
What is in the end to be despoiled,<br>
Begins by being first richly endowed.

(I like the shrunken/stretched, thrown down/set on high, and despoiled/endowed pairs, but something about the "in the end" doesn't ring quiet right. It implies an end, a finality, rather than an ever ongoing cycle.)

### 36. An Auspicious Beginning (RG)

The principle is simple: from one thing comes another. So it is that before there can be mastery, there must be errors; before there can be knowledge, there must be ignorance; before there can be understanding, there must be confusion; before there can be wisdom, there must be foolishness.

(I like this "pre-conditions" framing, especially targeting it as wisdom)

### XXXVI (DCL)

If you would have a thin shrink,<br>
You must first stretch it;<br>
If you would have a thing weakened,<br>
You must first strengthen it;<br>
If you would have a thing laid aside,<br>
You must first set it up;<br>
If you would take from a thing,<br>
You must first give to it.<br>
This is called subtle dsicernment.

## Water

- Nothing is as soft, weak, submissive, yielding as water.
- Nothing can surpass it. Nothing can take its place. Nothing can alter it. 
- Changing overcomes unchanging. Shapeless water takes the shapes of everything.

### 78. Paradoxes (UKLG)

Nothing in the world<br>
is as soft, as weak, as water;<br>
nothing else can wear away<br>
the hard, the strong,<br>
and remain unaltered.<br>
Soft overcomes hard,<br>
weak overcomes strong.<br>
Everybody knows it,<br>
nobody uses the knowledge.

### LXXVIII (DCL)

In the world there is nothing more submissive and weak than water. Yet for attacking that which is hard and strong nothing can surpass it. This is because there is nothing that can take its place.

### Chapter 78 (AW)

... For they can find no way of altering it.

### 78. Closest To All Thoughts (RG)

The softness and yielding of water overcomes the hardness and strength of stone. Changing overcomes unchanging.
Shapeless water takes the shapes of everything. Unchanging thinking cannot understand everything's changing; struggling thinking cannot understand everything's yielding.

### 61. Lying Low (UKLG)

The polity of greatness<br>
runs downhill like a river to the sea,<br>
joining with everything,<br>
woman to everything.

### LXI (DCL)

A large state is the lower reaches of a river â€“<br>
The place where all the streams of the world unite.<br>
In the union of the world.
