> “The Way is not difficult for those who have no preferences.”<br>&mdash; the Third Chinese Patriarch of Zen

## Gathered notes

We suffer when we add stories, shoulds, and preferences. This includes the Inner Critic's judgements about ourselves.

There's only Suchness: everything “just as it is”. Preferences reinforce concepts and strongly reinforce the sense of self. We suffer when we cling to our preferences and identify with them.

The practice is to more and more allow what it is, to experience things as they are. Fewer and fewer added stories, shoulds, and preferences. Welcoming, accepting what is, compassionate allowing. [No shoulds, no coulds, just goods](/thinking/the-three-uhds/).

Our personality and behaviours will still be there. But the sense of self is lighter, looser, more open. Open, fresh, don't-know mind.

## Raw notes

- Preferences act as a strong reinforcing mechanism for the idea of the self. When we really observe desire or aversion arising as phenomena in and of themselves, we start to see that they can arise without the need for any self to be implicated in them.
- In our doubt, we cling to overt or subtle meditative techniques to minimize the amount of time we spend caught up thoughts while sitting zazen. Our natural preferences morph into judgments, even if parts of us resist those judgments.
- Personality behaviours can still show up, but there's no sense of self. There are still preferences, but they're not rooted in a sense of self. Openness, freshness, don't-know-ing.
- Learning from someone with more experience can be critical in differentiating a helpful eclecticism from simply indulging our preferences.
- “The Way is not difficult for those who have no preferences.”
- Suchness: everything is “just as it is,” nothing added. No added stories, expectations, reactions, shoulds, preferences, or concepts
- It is a practice of no preferences, no judgments, no shoulds or shouldn’ts, no ideas of failure. It is a practice of simply allowing what is.
- No preferences, no judgments, complete welcoming, accepting what is, compassionate allowing.
- One sure way to make something an object and hence conceptual is to prefer it or not prefer it so something else. "The Great Way is not difficult for those who have no preferences."
- We start “living out of” our realization more and more, which means experiencing things, people, and precepts more often just as they are with no added stories, expectations, reactions, shoulds, preferences, or concepts.
- The suffering is when we are attached to our preferences or identified with them.
- Our emotions transform preferences into demands.
