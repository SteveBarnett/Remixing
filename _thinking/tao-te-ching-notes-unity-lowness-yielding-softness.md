A few hot topics for me at the moment.

Using my favourite version, Ursula Le Guin's [Lao Tzu: Tao Te Ching â€“ A Book About the Way and the Power of the Way](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/lao-tzu-the-tao-te-ching), as a base.

I didn't find readings I liked for Unity, Lowness, and Yielding this time. But I did find a few nice variations on Softness.

<div markdown="1" class="boxout-light">
- Hardness, stiffness, inflexibility, strength, go with death.
- **Tenderness, softness, yielding, suppleness, weakness, go with life.**
</div>

Reacting and responding, bending and bowing under pressure, means you're alive.

## Unity

### 1. Taoing (ULG)

Heaven and earth<br>
begin in the unnamed;<br>
<strong>name's the mother<br>
of the ten thousand things.</strong>

### 14. Celebrating Mystery (ULG)

<strong>Triply undifferentiated,<br>
it merges into oneness</strong>,<br>
not bright above,<br>
not dark below.

## Lowness

### 62. Lying Low (ULG)

<strong>The polity of greatness<br>
runs downhill like a river to the sea,<br>
joining with everything</strong>,<br>
woman to everything.

...

Lie low to be on top,<br>
be on top by lying low

### 66. Lowdown (ULG)

Lakes and rivers are lords of the hundred valleys<br>
Why? Because they'll **go lower**.<br>
So they're the lords of the hundred valleys.

Just so, a wise soul,<br>
wanting to be above other people,<br>
talks to them from below<br>
and to guide them<br>
follows them.<br>

## Yielding

### 69. Using Mystery (ULG)

The expert in warfare says:<br>
Rather than dare make the attack<br>
I'd take the attack<br>
rather than dare advance an inch<br>
I'd retreat a foot.

<strong>Nothing's worse than attacking what yields.<br>
To attack what yields is to throw away the prize.</strong>

ULG note: The prize thrown away by the aggressor is compassion. The yielder, the mourner, keeps that prize. The game is loser take all.

## Softness

### 76. Hardness (ULG)

Living people<br>
are soft and tender.<br>
Corpses are hard and stiff.<br>
The ten thousand things,<br>
the living grass, the trees,<br>
are soft, pliant.<br>
Dead, they're dry and brittle.

So hardness and stiffness<br>
go with death;<br>
<strong>tenderness, softness,<br>
go with life.</strong>

### 76 (SM)

Whoever is stiff and inflexible<br>
is a discipline of death.<br>
Whoever is soft and yielding<br>
is a discipline of life.

### 76 (AW)

What is stiff and hard is a "companion of death"; what is soft and weak is a "companion of life".

### LXXVI

The hard and the strong are the comrades of death; the supple and weak are the comrades of life.
