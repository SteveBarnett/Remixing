## Session notes

Note to self: this feels like it's covering the same ground as [the Keep Going session](/thinking/keep-going-omb-session/) from the end of last year. That covered only up, judging, and no goal.

### Intro

Feeling stuck? Like you're going backwards?

- You're not alone
- And, you're probably progressing justine

This session offers multiple viewpoints. The idea is that this gives us a clearer, more complete, picture. Something closer to a truth.

We can, and do, make progress. But often in not in the way we *think* we do.

### Progress as gain

- Meditation is about doing less, stopping doing things
- It's not about doing more, adding more

> No particular, specific, outcome required. Just all of us, making our mistakes, and noticing that they happen. &mdash; Joan Tollifson

### Judging progress

- Judging is just another thought that we can let go
- Not better, not different, only the immediate, bright, now
- Listen to your thoughts a little
    - They can be alarm bells to pay attention to something
    - But turn the alarm off once you've noticed it
    - Don't assume your thoughts are true
- We all becomes disillusioned about our progress
    - "I'm still suffering. Even with the progress I've made."  
- We get better be being more at peace with not being better
- Long-term peace doesn't come from achieving the next goal
    - There's always another goal

> The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change. &mdash; Carl Rogers

### Progress is only upwards

- The society we live in and our human brains tend to tell us that progress is only upwards
- Progress can be irregular
- Progress can be interrupted, stopped, by doubt, confusion
- Progress can happen while we're moving backwards, or going in circle
- Progress can be slow
- Progress can happen when we're lost, broken

### Doubt, one of the Five Hindrances

- Doubt as in lack of conviction, or trust in oneself
- Practice is not about finding perfection. It's more about dropping our want/need for progress and seeing the completeness, perfection, that's already here
- Negative Capability: remain in doubt and uncertainty. 
- Tension-in-doubt
    - Great faith and great doubt, kept in balance by great determination

> Just being alive is enough &mdash; Shinryu Suzuki

### Progress is visible, quantifiable, measurable

- We're not always aware of the progress we're making
    - Every time we're quiet and still, it registers in our unconscious
    - Something is going on beneath the surface
    - Like the roots of a tree, underground, unseen
- Meditation metrics: length, width, depth
- Measuring is avoiding being present
- A new tool or technique or teacher can be disguised resistance or aversion
- Just be here, again and again and again

> Practice is like walking in a fine mist. After some time you find you are thoroughly wet. It doesn’t take any special effort. &mdash; Shunryu Suzuki

- I'm going to offer a few different ideas and angles on progress in meditation and mindfulness practice.
- Looking from multiple angles, integrating multiple viewpoints, can be useful. It can bring us closer to a truth by giving us a more complete picture of reality.
- Meditation is about opening and relaxing with whatever arises, without picking and choosing. 
- Progress is about ...
- These two can balance each other out.

Progress

There are a few things we can notice about our attitude to progress, given the world we live in and the way our brains work. These are tendencies, not absolute truths.

- We measure progress by what's been gained
- We assume progress is always upward
- We assume progress is visible and quantifiable and measurable

In our practice, we might think about progress in terms of:

- How long we meditate
- How deep we concentration is
- How enlightened or awakened we are

Give yourself a little self-compassion when you’ve put in a lot of effort, but can’t point to a triumph
Still on the surface doesn’t mean no movement.
Maybe we’re progressing just fine.

Something like: you can't make progress. But progress can happen. And if you keep meditating, it will.
Direct, applied, effort doesn't produce progress. At least not quite in the way we think, with the effect we think.

> Practice is like walking in a fine mist. You hardly notice, but after some time you find you are thoroughly wet.
&mdash; Shunryu Suzuki

No particular, specific, outcome required. Just all of us, making our mistakes, and noticing that they happen.

- The Hindrance of Uncertainty, or Skeptical Doubt
- Negative Capability: remain in doubt and uncertainty. 

- Measuring progress is a great way to avoid being present here and now.
- After a while we unconsciously start to practice self-compassion as a way to get rid of bad feelings, which is nothing more than a slick new form of resistance.
Looking for it means overlooking it.
- It’s not about some better or different experience, but rather, it’s here in the immediacy of this experience.

- “This isn’t it” is just a thought. A seductive, hypnotic, one! But just a thought. Notice that.
- “I’m not getting it” is just a thought. “I’ve got it!” is just a thought.
- Is it really a problem? What happens when you stop framing it as a problem?
- maybe the most important way in which they get better is that we are more at peace with them not being better.
- Any true meditation practice is humiliating and disappointing because you can no longer believe that you are better.
- Suzuki Roshi once said, “Just being alive is enough.”
- Sometimes the best things to do is to sit with not-knowing, not-knowing if there’s gain, or progress, of burdens and barriers removed

- Long-term peace doesn’t come from fixing the problem, eliminating the problem. More problems come soon enough.
- It’s not having a problem with the endless stream of problems.

- Progress on the path is not straightforward, linear.
- Progression through the koan system varies from person to person, but most often it is irregular, with periods of smooth sailing interrupted by moments of self-doubt and confusion.
- Sooner or later everyone becomes disillusioned about their progress. The disillusionment stage sets in when we come to the awkward realization that we’re still suffering; maybe less so, but we’re still the same person with the same problems.
- Things can progress in reverse, as they fall apart, when we’re lost

Meditation is about opening and relaxing with whatever arises, without picking and choosing.

- Not trying to solve a problem.
- Not striving to make pain go away.
- Not trying to become a better person.
- Just be here again and again and again.

- Practice is like walking in a fine mist. After some time you find you are thoroughly wet. It doesn’t take any special effort.
- Doubt as a hindrance, some classical vibes.
    - Negative Capability: remain in doubt and uncertainty.
    - In our doubt, we cling to overt or subtle meditative techniques to minimize the amount of time we spend caught up thoughts while sitting zazen. Our natural preferences morph into judgments, even if parts of us resist those judgments.
    - Withhold judgement, remain in uncertainty and doubt.
    - Extreme tension-in-doubt. Great faith and great doubt kept in dynamic equilibrium balanced by great determination.
    - Great faith, great doubt, and great determination, the three pillars of sound practice.
    - (One of the five hindrances) Doubt (vicikiccha): lack of conviction or trust in one's abilities.
    - The Hindrance of Uncertainty, or Skeptical Doubt 
        - don’t try to shut down your faculty of critical thinking permanently (as if that were possible), just postpone evaluative thoughts until an appropriate time.
        - the Buddhist path of practice doesn’t depend on us finding these perfect situations (fortunately!). Instead, we’re being asked to drop all self-centered desire and fear, and recognize the perfection immanent in this moment, right here, right now.
- Just keep showing up. The way takes care of itself. Just practising is always good enough.
- No particular, specific, outcome required. Just all of us, making our mistakes, and noticing that they happen.


- Movement and thought occurs in the content, not the context.
    - Including seeking.
    - Including "I've got it!"
    - Including "I'm not getting it!"
- Just leave everything in its place.
- Progress is an illusion.
    - "I'm not getting it" is the same as "I've got it!" 
    - Measuring progress is a great way to avoid being present here and now.
    - "This isn't it" is just a thought. A seductive, hypnotic, one! But just a thought. Notice that.
- Give up, let go, rest.
    - Just leave everything in its place.
    - Give up the fight. Put it down. Leave it there.
    - Looking for things that weren't really lost, like glasses on your head or keys on the table
- Is it really a problem? What happens when you stop framing it as a problem?

- Long-term peace doesn't come from fixing the problem, eliminating the problem. More problems come soon enough.
- Deeper peace is always and already here.
- It's not having a problem with the endless stream of problems.
- Give up the fight. Put it down. Leave it there.
- Looking for it means overlooking it.

- “Practising to get better” and “practising because it’s how we want to be” balance each other excesses out.
- Progress on the path is not straightforward, linear.

- Sooner or later everyone becomes disillusioned about their progress. The disillusionment stage sets in when we come to the awkward realization that we’re still suffering; maybe less so, but we’re still the same person with the same problems.
- After a while we unconsciously start to practice self-compassion as a way to get rid of bad feelings, which is nothing more than a slick new form of resistance.
- radical acceptance—stage three. Most of our self-improvement strategies eventually fail because they’re based on resistance rather than acceptance.
- learned to say a gentle but firm “No, not now” to the inner voice that was criticizing her for not doing better

- Progression through the koan system varies from person to person, but most often it is irregular, with periods of smooth sailing interrupted by moments of self-doubt and confusion.

- It’s not about some better or different experience, but rather, it’s here in the immediacy of this experience.

- Suzuki Roshi once said, “Just being alive is enough.”
- maybe the most important way in which they get better is that we are more at peace with them not being better.
- Any true meditation practice is humiliating and disappointing because you can no longer believe that you are better,

- “No-self” doesn’t mean no responsibility, or no potential for change. We can shine the light of awareness on things so there are more choices and possibilities, allow better choices. It’s all part of the show. 

- Meditation is about opening and relaxing with whatever arises, without picking and choosing.
    - Not trying to solve a problem.
    - Not striving to make pain go away.
    - Not trying to become a better person.
    - Just be here again and again and again.

### Highlights

an unwholesome orientation that’s common in the West: Gaining. Given all that we’re told and sold, modern people seem destined to believe that acquiring is what came here to do and that achievement is how to measure a life. From that strange view, we make slanted assumptions. We assume, for example, that progress is linear, that it points upward, that it’s contingent on attainment and that, for it to count, it should be visible and quantifiable. We worry that somehow we’re not “living our best lives” if we’re not becoming [insert superlative] every day. I’m not one to suggest that we lose our ambition—just that we hold a simultaneous truth:

Perhaps a more accurate and liberating view of “progress” is one that embraces its fullness. Things can progress quite well in reverse. They can progress as they fall apart. ... We can improve when utterly lost. Progress can happen when we stop trying to change. Surrender can be a powerful feat.

When we slow down and pay attention, we sense that to be alive is to be engaged in a curious karmic dance, one that’s subtle, fluid, and co-creative. Every moment, like it or not, choose it or not, we are being made and re-made, done and undone. Refinement is endless in the web of life, and metamorphoses that matter are often invisible to the eye, unconscious to the mind, and incalculable for the heart.

We are not the boss in the process of becoming.

As we work to make meaning of our lives, etching a unique offering into existence, may we give ourselves grace, a little self-compassion, when we strive but can’t see what’s shifted, when we effort but can’t point to a triumph.

Sometimes the most progressive act is to hold the question of gain unanswered, and allow ourselves to marvel at not-knowing, maybe never-knowing, what gifts are being given beyond understanding, what burdens taken away. 

From this view of progress, we embrace a numinous truth: that even when things on the surface idle, stall, swerve, or reverse, nevertheless—mysteriously, miraculously, karmically—we are progressing just fine.
