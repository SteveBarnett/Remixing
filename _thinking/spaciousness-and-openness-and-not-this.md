ANT: **And Not-This**.

- Look for yourself at zero distance.
- Notice you are boundless, open, space.
- Notice the wider space that contains "this" and "not-this".
    - They always exist together. The "not-this" is the backdrop to the "this."

## Theory

- **Your true nature is boundless, open, space.**
- **Anything you perceive reveals itself in this empty, still, silent, space.**
- Prefer the bigger, more integrated picture.
- **Accept the wider view of everything and its opposite.**
- Love, compassion, expressed as the complete lack of boundaries, separation, distance.

## Practice

Just noticing

- **Look for yourself, at zero distance.**
- Find just enough space to notice what's going on.
- Leave space for things to untangle themselves. 
- **Rest in the wider whole of this and not-this.**
- **Be, accept, the whole of your experience, not just some of it.**
