Notes from [The Open Path - Elias Amidon on the Waking Up app](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/pack/PK45BF6?code=SC541514D&share_id=43888F01&source=content%20share)

- No fault. No credit. Only happening.
- Try pausing. Stopping can be hard or impossible. But you can pause, stop for just a moment or two, or longer.
- Emptiness is not something. It's empty of itself too.
- Consider what yuo surrender, what you gain. For example: when you surrender your opinions about your thoughts.
- Don't land in an assertion. Fall into the gap.
