From [Enneagram of Personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality).

I'm particularly interested pairs and poles as a way of getting a handle on an idea: 

- Basic fear vs Basic desire;
- Vice vs Virtue;
- Stress/ Disintegration vs Security/ Integration.

## An example

- Type: 1
- Characteristic role: Reformer, Perfectionist
- Ego fixation: Resentment
- Holy idea: Perfection
- Trap: Perfection
- Basic fear: Corruptness, imbalance, being bad
- Basic desire: Goodness, integrity, balance
- Temptation: Hypocrisy, hypercriticism
- Vice / Passion: Anger
- Virtue: Serenity
- Stress/ Disintegration: Individualist, Romantic
- Security/ Integration: Enthusiast, Epicure
