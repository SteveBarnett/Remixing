Notes on, in particular, the use of **opposites** in [Kelly Boys](https://kellyboys.org/) [Easing the Nervous System series on the Waking Up app](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/pack/PKAC84D?code=SC541514D&share_id=DA78BC13&source=content%20share).

## Very short version

1. Notice the emotion or thought
2. Find the opposite
2. Notice the opposite
3. Go back and forth
4. Notice both simultaneously
5. Notice the third experience

## Opposites Pendulum Practice (OPP)

A felt inquiry, not something to figure out. About meeting, skilfully moving towards, and welcoming what's there. Loosening resistance to it. Finding it's opposite and the larger space that contains both. With kind, curious, attention.

1. Notice the emotion or thought
    - Notice what images and sensations come along with it
    - Allow yourself to embody it
    - Notice the substantiality of it. Notice the insubstantiality of it.
2. Find the opposite
    - If this wasn't here what would be here, as its opposite, for you?
    - Invite it into awareness
2. Notice the opposite
    - Notice what images and sensations come along with it
    - Allow yourself to embody it
    - Notice the substantiality of it. Notice the insubstantiality of it.
    - This too arises, this too is here
3. Go back and forth between the emotion or thought and its opposite
4. Sense both simultaneously as body sensations, the whole spectrum
    - Just being with the passing phenomenon of the mind
5. Is there a third experience that emerges as you hold these opposites?
    - Make space for anything that wants to be acknowledged or seen from the holding of the opposites together
    - Notice a third way, from a depth of wisdom
    - The welcoming presence thatâ€™s here, whatever shifting state is coming and going

### Introduction

- An emotion you're feeling, or one you want to work pro-actively with to understand and meet more fully
- **Welcoming it, while finding its opposite on the emotional spectrum**
- **Meet it and metabolise it**

## Meditation

- Welcome any emotion that's present, as it is, on its own terms
- When you feel it, where and how do you feel it in your body?
    - **With kind, curious, attention**
- Welcome it. You may not like it. Be with it as it is.
- Notice how it feels so real, so salient, as a felt sense in the body rather than as a thought.
- Notice its insubstantiality, how it moves and shifts
- Background feeling of wellbeing in the body
- **Loosen the resistance to it, move towards skilfully meeting it and welcoming it, as it is**
    - Letting go of the images, pictures, stories, of it
    - Just the first-hand experience
- Feel all the way into the opposite
- **If this emotion weren't here, what would be here, as its opposite for you**
- Invite that emotion into awareness, allow yourself to embody the opposite
- Notice what images and sensations come along with it
- **Feel the salience and significance of this emotion too**
- **Feel the insubstantiality of this emotion too as a passing phenomenon in experience**
- Now return to the first emotion, the sensations, the images and thoughts
    - This too arises, this too is here
- Allow the breath to help you welcome it
- Now shift back to the opposite
- Feel it rather than try to figure it out
- **Go back and forth between the emotion and its opposite**
- **Sense both simultaneously as body sensations, the whole spectrum**
- **Keep relaxing into the surface that's supporting you**
- **Is there a third experience that emerges as you hold these opposites?**
    - **Make space for anything that wants to be acknowledged or seen from the holding of the opposites together**
    - Take your time here
- **Feel yourself as natural awareness**, aware of the emotions
- **The welcoming presence that's here, whatever shifting state is coming and going**

## [Meeting Thoughts](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/course/CO92D29?code=SC541514D&share_id=B06C27D2&source=content%20share)

### Introduction

- A thought. A limiting belief, or a judgment, a should
- We'll work on understanding it, it's opposite, and finding a deeper truth

### Meditation

- Notice the breath, attune to it, as it is, without trying to change or control it
- The same with any body sensations, Notice and allow.
- Sense opposites of warmth and coolness in the body
- Going back and forth between these opposites of sensation
- Let go the label of "warm" or "cool" and just be with the experience
- Now hold both at once. Notice it all as sensation.
    - Maybe even indistinguishable from each other
- **Welcome** a thought. A judgement, a worry, a limiting belief. Any thought at all.
- Consider the thought. Notice how you feel in your body when you believe it to be true.
    - Notice how we fuse with the thought when we take it to be true
    - Notice the impact on the body and the mind
- Now notice how the thought is **inherently insubstantial**, just a string of words, ungraspable
- **Now sense the opposite. If you didn't believe this thought, what thought would be there instead?**
    - **Feel how you feel in your body when you believe this opposite thought.**
    - **Notice the substance of it, and the insubstantiality.**
- Go back and forth, and **notice a third way**, **from a depth of wisdom**
- Now hold both oppposites
    - Relax into your whole body, witnessing awareness of the thoughts coming and going, **holding the whole**
    - **A felt inquiry, not something to figure out**
    - **Is there a third way, a deeper insight that emerges?** More wisdom, more perspective.
    - Can be as simple as "things are okay"
    - **Just being with the passing phenomenon of the mind**
- You are not your thoughts, but you can work skilfully with them
