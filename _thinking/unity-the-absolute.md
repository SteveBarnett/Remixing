## One Bright Pearl

Bringing together bits to keep the [One Bright Pearl](/thinking/zen/one-bright-pearl/) feeling going. It's all in the same pot, but my focus is less on the emptiness angle and more on the connectedness and interbeing angle.

- There's an underlying unity and wholeness to Reality
- Reality exploring and realising itself
- Nothing else but it, nothing outside it to compare it to
- Everything showing up together all at once
- Everything is relative, everything depends on everything else
- The infinite causes and conditions of Reality create everything, including our bodies, actions, thoughts, stories
- There's distinction, but not division
- Thought divides Reality up, separates, labels, judges, then invents stories
- Like the unity of birds and sky, fish and water
- The direct experience of unity is not a subjective "I" witnessing it, but an objective view, including us
- The experience of the Absolute is inwardly like wood or stone (motionless), outwardly like the void (without bounds or obstructions)
- Zen practice is integrating The Absolute and the Relative, without losing their distinctness
- Fully being in the Relative is how we touch the Absolute
- From the perspective of the Absolute there is only what is: no problems, no choices, no separation, no shoulds, no coulds

## Polished bits

## Gathered bits

### Unity

- Things that seems separate are manifestations of the underlying unity.
- Orient towards unity, wholeness, the peace therein.
- Notice and orient towards the underlying unity and wholeness.
- The Buddha Way is a way of unity. The Way is a way that transforms from many to one.
- That sense of unity is the basis of compassion. You take care of everything like you take care of yourself.
- Koans help us directly and intimately experience (perfect and all-encompassing) reality itself. Beyond objective reasoning and toward ultimate unity.
- "Mu": a word that was meant to lead the student beyond objective reasoning and toward ultimate unity.
- The unity of the absolute and the relative is the consummation of Zen practice.
- Oneness in the sense of an absolute unity. There is nothing else but it, nothing outside it to compare it to.
- One Mind, or Buddha-nature. The One here is not one as opposed to two or three but is rather oneness in the sense of an absolute unity. There is nothing else but it.
- The Absolute and the Relative integrated, in union.
- The unity of birds and sky, fish and water.
- Aim for experiential unity, keeping this distinction-but-not-division.
- Experiential unity without losing the pragmatic utility of the distinction between substance and function.
- A [component of an awakening experience](/thinking/zen/Components%20of%20an%20awakening%20experience/): a deep unity experience. Oneness, love. Not observing unity, a subjective, "I" witnessing it. An objective view, including us. The manifest aspect of the Absolute.
- Mystical experiences often include a feeling of unity. Optimistic, uplifting.
    - These include that the boundaries separating oneself and the “ultimate” reality seem to dissolve in a profound sense of “oneness” or unity. As a result, mystical experiences are typically “monistic” (i.e., all appears to be interconnected from within the experience) and “pantheistic” (i.e., everything appears to be one with the divine).
- Unity instead of putting things in boxes

#### Unicity

- There in only seamless unicity, everything showing up together all at once.
    - Difference and variation, but not separation.
    - There’s no separation between (seeming) opposites. Opposites are different ways of seeing Reality.
    - Everything comes from the totality, not from some separate self.
- There is only ever unicity exploring and realizing itself.
- Although everything is a manifestation of unicity, not everything is a manifestation of enlightenment.
- Unicity isn’t abstract or intellectual or mysterious or ellusive until we start analyizing it and thinking about it.
    - The nature of thought is to divide up and freeze what is actually indivisible and fluid.
    - Without words, there is no division.

### The Absolute (and The Relative)

- In Zen, Reality and Concepts are called Absolute and Relative.
- Form and emptiness, relative and absolute, appearance and disappearance, ocean and wave—one seamless whole.
- Using Zen words, you could say that unity is the Absolute and difference is Relative
- A [component of an awakening experience](/thinking/zen/Components%20of%20an%20awakening%20experience/): a deep experience of absence of self. No-self, emptiness. Can't answer "who are you?" because of lack of reference points. The unmanifest aspect of the Absolute.
- Experiencing the Absolute, realizing the Absolute, and acting out the Absolute in our daily affairs.
- Directly experiencing the essential nature of the absolute that is empty of all imaginary constructions and unchanged throughout all time is the fundamental way of Zen.
- The way of the true Buddhist is through the world, not avoiding its difficulties, not plunging into oblivion in the absolute.
- It's only by fully being in the Relative that can touch the Absolute
- The infinite causes and conditions of Reality create everything. From the perspective of the Absolute, there are no problems, no choices, no separation. No shoulds, no coulds, only what is.
- The Absolute is free of concepts, language, characteristics.
- The Absolute and the Relative integrated, in union.
- The experience of the Absolute is inwardly like wood or stone (motionless), outwardly like the void (without bounds or obstructions).
- There's relative differences or absolute oneness.
- Realisation of the absolute does not extinguish experience of the relative.
- The integration of the absolute and relative doesn't obliterate their distinctness.
- What is absolute, one, identical, universal, and noumenal set up in tension with what is relative, manifold, different, particular, and phenomenal.
- There are two levels of truth: conventional (relative, historical) truth and ultimate (absolute) truth. We need to pay attention to both.
- From absolute emptiness, allow a wondrous unfoldment of doing.

### Reality (from [MAP](/thinking/map/))

- Reality is one.
    - There are distinctions, but not divisions.
        - A network of interdependence and mutual support.
    - All forms are relational.
    - Things that are separate can't influence and act on each other.
    - The unity of Absolute and Relative, of emptiness and form.
- Reality is free of concepts, language, characteristics.
    - It’s empty of intrinsic, solid, stable, form(s), of boundaries.
    - Thinking, especially judging, creates separation, distance.

### The cosmos

- The cosmos is purposeful, patterned.
- Only the verb is required. There’s no separation of subject and object. There’s no doer.
- The cosmos is playful.
- The cosmos is consciousness as a verb.
- Consciousness is the cosmos becoming more aware of itself.

### Everything

- Everything is simply one movement. What we think of as outside of us and inside of us is one movement.
- Everything is happening on its own, without us “doing” it.
- The more one focuses on ideas and explanations, the less clear it becomes that everything is unexplainable movement, moving on its own.
- Everything is included (in Reality). The context. The contents, including seeking.
- Spiritual awakening points to the recognition of this unbound vastness that we are, this all-inclusive, unconditional love that is always accepting everything, this aware presence that often gets overlooked because attention is habitually focused on the me-story and the dramas in the movie of waking life.
- In Buddhism, ‘emptiness’ is not nothingness, it is the fluidity of existence. It may be defined as the relativity of things, the transience of things, the totality of things, the ultimate ungraspability of things: the unbroken continuity of everything.
- Every event is part of life. Everything is included. 
- Everything is happening on its own.
- The infinite causes and conditions of Reality create everything.
- Reality is one, complex, flow. Its causes and conditions create everything, including our bodies, actions, thoughts.
- Nothing, showing up as everything.
- Everything is included. Including your urges, impulses, thoughts and actions.
- Everything is relative, everything depends on everything else.
- Everything is inextricably connected with everything else. All things inter-are.
- In Reality, there are no choices. Everything happens on its own, including us creating the stories.
- Thought divides Reality up, labels everything, then invents stories.
- Everything happens effortlessly, including effort and confusion and resistance and rumination and indecision.
- Everything is impermanent, constantly changing, and interconnected with everything else. There is no inherent, independent, autonomous existence.
- Everything arises and passes away, all on its own.
