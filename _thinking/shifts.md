Shifts in awareness, perspective, things like that. Zooming in and/or zooming out, changing your plane of focus.

## Remixed, with pointers

Move from self-centered stories to an open, direct, embodied experience without a self.

- **Problem** and the need to solve it
- **Story** and the self it's happening to
- **Thoughts**
- **Embodied experience**
- **Nondual experience**

## Emotion Outshifting

I found this in the [Awakening Emotions session](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/course/COAAAE7ED?code=SC541514D&share_id=B5ECC392&source=content%20share) of Loch Kelly's Effortless Mindfulness course on [the Waking Up app](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/shareOpenAccess/SC541514D).

- I am `emotion`.
- I am aware of feeling `emotion`.
- I am the awareness.
- `emotion` is welcome.
- Awareness and `emotion` are not separate.

## RAIN

- **Recognize.**
	- Notice what's arising.
	- Name the emotions and feeling tones.
- **Allow.**
	- Give everything a warm welcome.
	- Be patient, wait a little longer.
- **Investigate.**
	- The embodied sense of it.
	- The story you're adding to the feeling tone and the raw sense data.
	- Deeper prodding
		- What are trying to protect yourself from?
		- What are you unwilling to feel?
		- What are you numbing or distracting yourself from?
		- If you dropped the story you're adding, what would you be doing instead?
- **Nurture.**
	- Find a sense of what would be comforting right now.

When you have trouble with the N of RAIN, go back to the I. Look more closely for what and where it's hurting.

After a RAIN meditation, stay in the open, awake, awareness for a while.

## My philosophy, another spiral

- <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>**Notice the causes, conditions, and patterns.** (Reality is one, indivisible, whole)
- <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>**Look for the edges, the gaps between.** (Concepts create division, layers, stages, often as poles)
- <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>**Notice the motion, the changes. Watch it arise, watch it pass away.** (Reality is flow, motion, change)
- <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>**Look for what's static, fixed.** (Concepts are fixed, static)
- <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>**Notice the fractal nature of everything.** (Reality is complex, deep, rich)
- <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>**Remember that the map is not the territory.** (Concepts flatten, simplify, exclude)
- <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>**Notice (the details of) the map you're using.** (Who you are determines how you see determines what you see.)
- <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>**Take the more integrated picture, multiple viewpoints at once.** (What qualities you see depends on the scale.)
- <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>**Come back to the direct, embodied, experience. <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>**Look for yourself, at zero distance.** (Your true nature is the context of consciousness, not the contents.)
- <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>**Notice the causes, conditions, patterns that make you who you are. <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Leave things as they are, without adding a story or a label.** (The contents of consciousness arise in the world.)

## Radical nonduality

Remixed and lifted from [my Painting the Sidewalk with Water notes](/painting-the-sidewalk-with-water/).

- <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>**Look closely for solidity, substance, continuity in any form.** (Forms have flow, motion, change.)
- <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>**Look for the doer in non-human things. Is there an entity in there that is changing from a seed to a tree?** (The “doer”, “thinker,” the “author,” the “chooser”, the "self" is only an image, an idea, another thought.)
- <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>**Look for thinker of thoughts and notice its absence.**
- <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>**Notice that the need to solve the problem is a story.** (Nothing is really a problem. Concepts, including the self, and their stories create problems, confusion, suffering.)
- <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>**Notice the problem itself is a story.**
- <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>**Notice that the self is a story.**
- <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>**Bring open attention, simply notice what is. Without any agenda or goal. Without wanting to change or control or correct.**
- <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>**Look for the looker. If you see the looker, look for who's looking at that. Notice that you are prior to any object you can see.** (Some sense of self is functionally necessary and unavoidable.)
- <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>**Notice the playful nature of everything.** (The cosmos is exploring and realising itself, playing hide and seek. It enjoys finding and being found, again and again.)
