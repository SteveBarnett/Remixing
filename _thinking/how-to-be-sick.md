## Gathered notes

- Buddha was realistic and honest about the human condition rather than pessimistic
- unpleasant and painful experiences are part of the human condition
    - we create dukkha — suffering, stress, anguish — when we resist this
- we have an “unquenchable thirst” to have only pleasant experiences and not unpleasant ones
- impermanence is necessary for life and growth
    - But it brings uncertainty and unpredictability
    - And we crave security and assurance
- What happens in life arises out of conditions, not from a “me” in control
- Don't treat the inner critic voice as an authentic, fixed feature of yourself
- To see if your words are genuinely intended to alleviate your suffering, ask if these are words you’d use to comfort a loved one
- Give in instead of give up
- Kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity. The goal is to cultivate them until they become the natural response to whatever you encounter in life.
- Once clinging or attachment to the object of our desires and aversions takes hold, the sense of a solid self arises

## Raw highlights

### Preface to the Revised Edition

- The book’s coverage includes the following: weathering the relentlessness of symptoms coming to terms with a more isolated life
- for spouses, partners, or other caregivers, adapting to so many unexpected and sometimes sudden life changes.

- Byron Katie - painful thoughts and emotions come and go.

### How Everything Changed

- Pain Is Part of Life

#### The Buddha Tells It Like It Is

- people sometimes say that Buddhism is pessimistic. It’s not to me, though. The Buddha was simply being realistic and honest about the human condition.
- the day-to-day work of making peace with the realization that unpleasant and painful experiences are part of the human condition, and that we create dukkha — suffering, stress, anguish — when we resist this.
- The Buddha didn’t say that life is only made up of the unpleasant experiences on his list. He was simply emphasizing that difficulties are present in the life of all human beings.
- In our modern world, however, this bias to continually seek what’s pleasant and react with aversion to what’s unpleasant doesn’t always serve us well.
- “the unquenchable thirst.” We experience it as an intense wanting — even a felt need — to have only pleasant experiences and not to have unpleasant ones. But neither of these two desires can be satisfied because they don’t reflect the realities of the human condition.

#### 4 The Universal Law of Impermanence

- Thich Nhat Hanh points out that impermanence is the very condition necessary for life. Without it,
nothing could grow or develop.
- With impermanence comes uncertainty and unpredictability. These two characteristics of the human
condition can be a deep source of anxiety and stress for us because we crave the opposite: security and
assurance
- Broken-Glass Practice
- The Buddha taught that all that arises is subject to change, decay, and dissolution.

### 5 Who Is Sick? Who Is in Pain?

- “no-fixed-self,” depending on the context. It is the principal way in which he broke from the religion of his birth, Hinduism.
- “bikeness.” It is the same with humans. There is no immutable, unchanging personality (“Toni Bernhard”) that exists as an entity separate from the arising and passing of physical and mental activity
— activity that is conditioned by preceding causes.
- No phenomenon — mental or physical — exists separate and independent from the conditions that give rise to
- What happens in life arises out of conditions, not from a “me” in control.

### 6 Finding Joy in the Life You Can No Longer Lead

- Buddhism understands an emotion to be a thought plus a physical reaction to that thought.
- Here’s a crucial point, and it doesn’t only apply to empathetic joy — it applies to all four sublime states. Their cultivation is not to be looked upon as a pass/fail test.
- sticking with a practice begins to change your conditioned response.
- Being kind to myself in this way enabled me to drop the painful stories I was spinning about how unfair life can be.

### 7 Soothing the Body, Mind, and Heart

- A shift occurred, and the end of suffering I wished for became the end of suffering in the mind.

### 8 Using Compassion to Alleviate Your Suffering

- Thich Nhat Hanh. In his book The Diamond That Cuts through Illusion,
- I’d never talk to others that way.
- Here I’m going to offer five other practices I use to cultivate compassion for myself.
- Disidentify from Your Inner Critic
    - For several years I’ve been working to turn that inner critic into an inner ally who will refuse to disparage me, just as I refuse to disparage those I care about. Taming the inner critic is truly an act of self-compassion.
    - The practice that has been most helpful is called disidentifying — that is, not treating the inner critic voice as an authentic, fixed feature of yourself.
    - You’ll recognize that the critic is present because you’ll hear the words should and shouldn’t, and you’ll realize that you’re directing blame at yourself.
- Craft Phrases That Directly Address Your Suffering
    - Rather than using nonspecific phrases such as “May I be free from suffering,” choose a set of words that speak directly to the specific circumstances that are making you sad, disappointed, or dispirited.
    - If speaking to yourself seems odd, reflect on how your inner critic doesn’t have any trouble speaking words of criticism to you. If you can talk to yourself in harsh and self-judgmental ways, there’s no reason not to talk to yourself in soothing, gentle, self-compassionate ways instead.
    - To see if your words are genuinely intended to alleviate your suffering, ask if these are words you’d use to comfort a loved one who shared his or her suffering with you.
    - This has brought me to tears sometimes, but tears of compassion are healing tears.
- instead of following through on an initial impulse to be generous, I force myself, in this compassion practice, to do the reverse of my initial impulse.
- The principal feature that Sharon’s practice and my practice share is how, unless we remain vigilant by cultivating awareness — often called “mindfulness” — the mind can talk us into or out of just about anything, no matter how counterproductive or harmful the consequences.
- Once again, the storyline I’d spun regarding someone else’s motives failed to reflect what was really going on.
- Patient endurance suggests that, in addition to being patient (that is, serene and uncomplaining), we actively “endure”; we survive difficulties, we face hardship without giving up.
- Open Your Heart to Your Suffering
- Sometimes it’s difficult to label stressful mental states without falling prey to aversion,
- My heart is big enough to hold this
- Many of us have to overcome a lifetime of conditioning in which we were taught that looking after our own well-being is selfish. It’s not. We are as worthy of our care and compassion as anyone.

### 9 Facing the Ups and Downs of Chronic Illness with Equanimity

- it helps to have both inspirational teachings and practical techniques at hand.
- Whatever happens, it’s okay.
- the essence of equanimity is accepting life as it comes to us without blaming anything or anyone — including ourselves.
- consciously starting a sentence with these words: “It’s okay if..."
- Letting go, even just a little.
- Giving in instead of giving up.
- The challenge with equanimity practice is to not let accepting things the way they are slip into indifference, because indifference is a subtle aversion to life as it is.
- accepting what we cannot change and then looking for how to live a fulfilling life within our limitations.
- Accepting loss.
- kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity. The goal is to cultivate them until they become the natural response to whatever you encounter in life.

### 10 Getting Off the Wheel of Suffering

- Having reacted with desire or aversion to what we’ve come in contact with through our six senses, the mind sticks like glue to the desire or the aversion.
- Once clinging or attachment takes hold, the sense of a solid self arises
- we are reborn moment to moment into self-identities we create by clinging or attaching to the objects of our desires and aversions.
- That split second between the experience of a pleasant or unpleasant sensation and the arising of desire for more of the former or aversion to the latter is the doorway out
- if we really “owned” our sensations in the sense of being fully able to control them, we’d never let those sensations be anything but pleasant!
- Practicing with the Wheel of Suffering and the Four Sublime States
- I found a way to break the vicious cycle of suffering. I did it by consciously moving my mind toward one of the four sublime states.

### 11 Tonglen: Spinning Straw into Gold

- In tonglen practice, however, the instruction is to do the opposite. We breathe in the suffering of the world and then, as we breathe out, we release that suffering and offer others whatever measure of kindness, compassion, and peace of mind we have to give. It’s a counterintuitive practice, which is why the Buddhist nun and teacher Pema Chödrön says that tonglen reverses ego’s logic.
- “Breathe in the suffering of others; breathe out thoughts of kindness, compassion, and peace.”

### 12 With Our Thoughts We Make the World

- “With our thoughts we make the world.”
- Byron Katie - “The Work”
- Byron Katie’s five-step inquiry practice to question the validity of the thought.
- In the first step, we ask whether the thought is true;
- In the second step, we ask whether we’re absolutely sure that it’s true.
- The third step in questioning the validity of a stressful thought is to notice how we feel when we believe the thought.
- The fourth step is to reflect on who we’d be without the thought.
- Then comes the counterintuitive fifth step, when Katie asks us to come up with a “turnaround.” The turnaround is a statement of the stressful thought in a way that’s opposite from its original expression.
- Once we settle on a turnaround, we’re to come up with at least three reasons why it might be true.
- “four questions and a turnaround.”
- putting all this down on paper — as she suggests we do because of the power of the written word
- Katie says she isn’t telling us to give up the stressful thought but to drop it for long enough to see who we’d be without it.
- this work is not necessarily about ridding oneself of stressful thoughts but rather about examining their validity.
- Buddha’s first and second noble truths: we create dukkha when we believe we must get our way.

### 13 The Present Moment as a Refuge

- more essential to me than formal meditation has been mindfulness outside of meditation.
- here are five simple practices that are easy to try. See which ones resonate with you.
- Describe Your Present-Moment Experience Objectively
    - Leaving out the emotional descriptors minimizes the likelihood that you’ll start spinning stressful stories that will only make you feel worse,
    - the only thing that was true for sure,
- Try Thich Nhat Hanh’s Mindfulness Exercises
    - In The Miracle of Mindfulness, the Vietnamese Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh offers several exercises for staying mindful of the present moment as we engage in activities of everyday life, from brushing our teeth to making the bed
- Half-smile while listening to music.
- Mindfulness while making tea.
- keep this sad or stressful memory strong in your mind and then . . . drop it.
    - As you do this, immediately direct your attention to some current sensory input.
    - Can you feel the relief?
    - Take your mind back in time to a stressful memory, and drop it. Take your mind forward in time to a stressful thought, and drop it.
    - When you drop it, you relax into the present moment and the suffering that was generated by your thoughts lifts as if you’ve shed a heavy weight.

### 14 Wise Action

- Wise inaction can thus be thought of as simply not engaging in those actions that make our condition worse.
- The challenge is to find the balance between too much and too little.
- Pacing refers to alternating periods of activity and rest.
- Pacing is the perfect example of combining wise action and wise inaction to improve quality of life
- Here are four suggestions that can help you succeed with this “treatment”:
    - Make a schedule.
    - Do tasks more slowly.
    - Try the 50 percent rule. Decide what you can comfortably do on a given day and then only do 50 percent of it.
    - Use three-breath practice to stop yourself when you’re doing too much.
- Caregivers: What to Do and What Not to Do
    - Under the category of wise action, I have four suggestions: Share with a friend or family member how hard it is for you at times.
    - Treat yourself with compassion over this unexpected change in your life.
    - Remember that just because you can’t cure your loved one doesn’t mean you can’t do things that will help him or her feel better.
    - Take care of your own health.

### 15 Zen Helps

- First, Zen has a unique ability to shock the mind out of its conventional way of perceiving the world.
- Second, Zen teachings help us realize how little we know for certain.
- Finally, Zen masters often teach by using poetic forms.
- **Treating it as a koan changes my relationship to this question**
- Thich Nhat Hanh comes at this Zen view of life from a different angle. He encourages us to examine each thought or precede each action with the reflection, “Am I sure?” This is a powerful teaching since attachment to views and opinions is such a source of suffering.
- book of gathas, Present Moment Wonderful Moment, Thich Nhat Hanh
- a book of gathas called The Dragon Who Never Sleeps, by Robert Aitken.

### 16 Communicating with Care

- many of the actions that cause the greatest suffering or bring about the greatest benefit in our lives are centered on one part of the body: the mouth.
- According to the Buddha, wise speech is endowed with five qualities. It is truthful, spoken with good will, spoken beneficially, spoken affectionately, and spoken at the right time. These are usually shortened to three considerations: speak only when what you have to say is true, kind, and helpful.
- idle chatter — frivolous and meaningless speech — is a distraction from truly important matters such as cultivating compassion and mindfulness
- a key concern the Buddha had about idle chatter was that it can easily degrade into divisive and abusive speech.

### 17 Connecting with Others and Appreciating Solitude

- “Language . . . has created the word ‘loneliness’ to express the pain of being alone. And it has created the word ‘solitude’ to express the glory of being alone.”
- These Buddhist and Buddhist-inspired practices are always waiting in the wings to help transform that neutral fact of isolation from the despair of loneliness to the serenity of solitude.

### 18 And in the End.

- Joko Beck’s teaching that our life is always all right. There’s nothing wrong with it even if we have terrible problems. It’s just our life.
