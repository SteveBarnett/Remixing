As usual, start with: What's on top? 

Then, sit silently with a question for a few minutes. You can approach it like a koan, or come at it a bit more analytically.

(Add a little background on koans)

- What would be enough?
- What's here when there's no problem to solve?
- What is this? (Like Stephen Batchelor's book)
- Who am I? (Approach it with a beginner's mind)
- What is your Original Face? The face you had before even your parents were born.
- What's always available?
- What (story) are you adding?
    - If you dropped the story you're adding, what would you be doing instead?
- What wants attention or acceptance right now?
- Does this lead towards suffering or away from it?
- What if the difficult people are there to help you wake up? (link this to metta from a few weeks before)
- Where have you come from?
- How far away from the object are your thoughts about the object?
- When you notice someone looking your way: what are they looking at?
- Who were you before that (part of your identity) existed?
- Who are you, once you've let everything go?
- Who will be the knower once the self is know? The knower must be the self.
