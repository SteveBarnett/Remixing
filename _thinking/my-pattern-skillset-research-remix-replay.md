Kind of "how I do everything." But not really. More like: a common way that I do things, and an update to [How I take notes](/thinking/how-i-take-notes/) (which could have been called "How I study" or "How I process things" or something like that).

A bit like: this is "my thing." My way of doing this that's a maybe a bit different to how others do it.

- **Research**. Take notes along the way. Look widely, look deeply.
    - This helps the idea(s) sink in.
- **Remix**. Note highlights, themes, big ideas. Group and shift similar ideas.
    - This clarifies and solidifies and refines the idea(s).
- **Replay**. Write up in a structured format.
    - This helps the idea(s) stick.

With waiting gaps in-between to allow some stewing, incubation.
