Notes from [A Conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyp06m9As7U).

- What are you looking out of?
- Can you **find** the person you take yourself to be?
- Stop getting in the way of just doing what needs to be done, in the moment.
- **Taste** nonduality, that you **are** the world.
- Love, compassion, expressed as the complete lack of boundaries, separation, distance.
- It's the world that points at your no-face.
