- We are not doing in the world. The world is doing us, like it does trees, clouds.
- The ends of a stick as separate objects aren't required, only the whole.
	- Two things doesn't come together to make something. They're inseparable parts of a whole.
	- The knower and the known aren't required, only the knowing.
- All phenomena exists as waves, peaks and troughs.
	- Sound is an alternation between sound and silence.
