Thinking about "Why Can't It Be Both" in terms of acceptance and holding happy and sad thoughts at the same time.


- Why can’t it be both?
- **Both/and instead of either/or.**
- All is included, all is needed: both/and, not either/or. **Considering and taking multiple perspectives and viewpoints to get something more truthful, because it’s a more complete picture.**
- Not either/or, but both/and. It seems a bit paradoxical. but only if we overthink it.
- **Embracing wholeness is a loving act of reclamation**, a “both/and” way of meeting life.
- I find it hard to hold opposites together, to sit in and with the larger space that holds both. I tend to flip-flop between the two poles instead, often energetically. Less like a pendulum swinging and more like a coin flipping.
    - I think my path through it is to hold the concepts of the two poles more lightly and notice how Reality, experience, does both. The poles have distinction, but not difference. They’re concepts, empty, partial truths.
- I keep coming back to a bar magnet as an analogy. It’s one thing. The magnetic force is a field, not a clean cut. But it does have positively charged end and a negatively charged end, and they are not the same.
- Recognise that **the causes and conditions of your life have made you like this.**
- Notice that **struggling against who you are doesn’t work, doesn’t help, and causes damage**.
- Take care of all the parts of who you are.
- **Don’t be in a hurry to find the source of bad feelings, to make them disappear; just illuminate them**.
- The deeper we look into any thing, the more we see its interbeing.
- **Don’t wait until you have no more suffering before allowing yourself to be happy.**
- Embrace your suffering, and let it reveal to you the way of peace.
- Our good intentions can evaporate when we’re unable to handle the pain welling up within ourselves.
- Deep understanding is the substance of which true love is made.
- **We don’t need a special effort, we don’t need to practice, to enjoy the beauty of the blue sky.**
- One Bright Flow
    - **The feeling of everything showing up together all at once**
    - **The feeling of happy, playful, bright activity**
- One Bright Pearl – my focus is less on the emptiness angle and more on the connectedness and interbeing angle.
- There’s a brightness to experience, awareness. I’m having some feelings of loss, grief, sadness. But even those are bright. Not happy, or wanted, maybe not even helpful. But the quality of their appearance, of everything that’s appearing, is bright. Bright like open, luminous, clear.
- The problem with our emotions is that we don’t relate to them as states.
- When we learn to acknowledge, embrace, and **understand of our suffering**, we suffer much less.
- The function of mindfulness is to recognise the suffering, then take care of it, embrace it, cradle it with tenderness.
- When a painful emotion comes up, stop whatever you’re doing and take care of it.
- It is a rare gift to simply meet with openness and clarity what life brings our way… We have the very mistaken belief that it’s simply not enough.
- **We risk missing the precious unfolding of life as it is right now in the pursuit of an imagined future outcome or destination.**
- **Question our beliefs about what we think our life should be and to turn our effort toward full presence of how it is.**
- Not let go of reality. Let go our of wrong ideas and perceptions about reality.
- **The way to be liberated from suffering is to be quickly absorbed into it.**
- If you can recognise and accept your pain without running away from it, you will discover that **joy can be there at the same time**.
- The liturgy of everyday life.
- **Our everyday life, filled with noise and lively activities of people**, might be the most convenient dojo to practice Zen in movement.
- The fundamental anxiety of being human, the fundamental ambiguity of being human: **the visceral experience of feeling that things aren’t right** 
- **Make friends with yourself as you are, not as you wish you are, or think you out to be, honestly and kindly.**
- **The practice is to stop and take care of, tenderly embrace, painful emotions as soon as they come up.**
- **Embracing and understanding our suffering generates love and compassion**, lets forgiveness arise naturally.
- **We’re allowed to feel happy now, before the end of all our suffering.**
- Shoulds and coulds are abstract concepts, not the living unified oneness that is Reality.
- **“I don’t like it” or “I don’t want it” or “I want it and I don’t have it” are all thoughts created by the mind. They create separation, a gap, that doesn’t really exist.**
- **What's the limiting belief that's stopping you from carrying on (not the same as getting over it)?**
- **Leave things as they are, without adding a label or a story**
- Easing the Nervous System by Kelly Boys on the Waking Up app
    - Noticing the context of consciousness comes after noticing, working with, and accepting the opposite
    - **Noticing and working with the opposite comes after noticing, working with, and accepting the initial experience**
- **The leap from the hundred-foot-pole (from the conditioned to the unconditioned) is immediate, sudden. But it takes time to build up the courage to jump.**
- **the foundational importance of acceptance.**
- **Suffering and struggle go together in a human life to create meaning and growth.**
- **The three uhds**
    - Let go of the shoulds.
    - Let go of the coulds.
    - Rest in the good(s).
