### What is it?

The idea that things and people are sometimes contradictory: they can be two seemingly different things at the same time.

Things can't exist without the concept of their opposite. There's no shadow without light. There's not us with them. There's no here without there.

### Why is it important?

It helps to see things and people as they are: complex. Being able to hold two (seemingly) contradictory ideas in your heads at once is a sign of emotional intelligence and maturity. It's also really difficult!
