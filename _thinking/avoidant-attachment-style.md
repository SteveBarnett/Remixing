Historically, I know I've had a bit of an avoidant attachment style. In particular, turning away from discomfort. These days, I try and turn towards it, make it awkward, talk about the difficult stuff.

## Highlights

I think the main change for me over the years has been behavioural. Although I still have those avoidant feelings, they're not as strong, and I follow through on them much less often.

I've also become much better at communicating my emotions and needs. Still not amazing, but much better. Realising and focusing on **openness** as one of my core values has been helpful.

Like every human, attachment style is just one of the many things that influence my thoughts, feelings, and actions. Some of the things under Avoidant Attachment are countered by other parts of how I'm made up, and some are perhaps made worse.

Something I'm wary of is something like false positives, misattribution, or confirmation bias. Noticing a thought pattern and/or a behaviour pattern and attributing it to Avoidant Attachment when perhaps the root cause it something else. A little si,ilar to my thinking (and resisting) that I wrote about on the [Traits](/thinking/traits/) page.

(An interesting, perhaps hilarious, aside is that Anxious and Avoidant Attachment people tend to get together. The two perspectives are almost opposites, which means they tend to view the other person as more extreme(ly into their side of the Attachment style) than they really are.)

### [Avoidant Attachment Style](https://www.simplypsychology.org/avoidant-attachment-style.html)

Avoidant attachment style refers to a psychological and emotional pattern characterized by an individual’s tendency to avoid emotional closeness and dismiss the importance of intimate relationships, often as a self-protective measure.

Avoidant individuals tend to have a negative view of others and a mostly positive view of themselves. They believe other people are untrustworthy and dishonest, whereas they themselves are confident and capable and do not need the support of anyone else. 

Individuals with an avoidant attachment style often have difficulty forming and maintaining deep emotional connections with others. They may feel uncomfortable with intimacy, fear dependence on others, and strongly desire independence and self-reliance.

For these individuals, avoidance and withdrawal become their strategy to protect themselves from experiencing more pain and abandonment.

Characteristics include:

- valuing independence over emotional closeness
- suppressing or downplaying emotions
- distrusting others
- relying on themself for emotional support
- and struggling to share their thoughts and feelings with others

Avoidant individuals tend to feel overwhelmed and uncomfortable when another person wants to be emotionally vulnerable and physically intimate.

### [Avoidant Attachment Style: Causes & Symptoms](https://www.attachmentproject.com/blog/avoidant-attachment-style/)

Avoidant attachment in adults may, from the outside, look like self-confidence and self-sufficiency. This is because the avoidant attachment style causes a low tolerance for emotional or physical intimacy and, sometimes, struggles with building long-lasting relationships. Furthermore, in the workplace, adults with avoidant attachment are often seen as the independent, “lone wolf” type. However, due to their self-sufficiency, they may also be high achievers.

Adults with the dismissive / avoidant attachment style seem to be pretty happy about who they are and where they are.

They might be very social, easy-going, and fun to be around. In addition, these individuals might have a lot of friends and/or sexual partners. Generally speaking, they are not alone or lonely.

Avoidant adults tend to be independent. Their self-esteem is high and they do not rely on others for reassurance or emotional support.

Such individuals might invest in their professional development and are likely to build up their confidence on each personal success. They seem to be in control.

For avoidant adults, social interactions and bonds remain on the surface.

These individuals will let you be around them, but will not let you in. They tend to avoid strong displays of closeness and intimacy. As soon as things get serious, dismissive/avoidant individuals are likely to close themselves off.

Adults with this attachment style believe that they do not need emotional intimacy in their lives.

This is a direct result of their upbringing. Their caregivers showed them that people cannot be relied on.

To the avoidant adult, emotional closeness and intimacy are often off the table. Not because they will not reap benefits, but because they do not know how.
