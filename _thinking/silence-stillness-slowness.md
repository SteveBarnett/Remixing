An idea that's stayed with me from [The Wisdom of Insecurity by Alan Watts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/551520.The_Wisdom_of_Insecurity) (a book with flavours of Zen and Daoism) is:

> Science and industry have **increased the tempo and violence of living**.

In particular, the modern world seems quite obsessed with speed. It shows up especially clearly when technology is involved: it tends to facilitate and encourage speed.

## Silence to stillness to slowness

This got me thinking about **silence** and **stillness**. Stillness feels like a large container. Silence feels like stillness in sound.

I let that sit for a bit, then realised that stillness isn't quite right.

- [Reality is one complex flow](/thinking/big-ideas/).
- The world is alive an moving all the time.
- [Motion is a key part of life](/thinking/all/#motion).

So maybe **slowness** is more what I'm circling around. Not stopping, but slowing.

In [Tao: The Watercourse Way](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/196329.Tao), another Alan Watts book, I picked out:

> Curb your ambition.<br>**Slow your tempo.**<br>Work with your hands.

Slow your tempo and pay clear, focused, attention. For me, this connects to [the sacred pause](/notes/?s=pause). Take a pause to be able to pay more clear, more focused, attention.

### Kaizen

This also connects to smallness. I enjoyed [The Kaizen Way by Robert Maurer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/266621.One_Small_Step_Can_Change_Your_Life). It talks about small steps, many times. That's in line with things like [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) and [Tiny Habits](https://tinyhabits.com/) which suggest small steps as ways to build habits and make change.

- It's difficult to take big steps slowly.
- It's easy to take small steps slowly.

## Now what?

- Slow your breathing
- Slow your actions
- Slow your reactions

Take your time. Not: be lazy. More like: be considered and careful.

- Slow your speech: be more quiet.
- Slow your hearing: listen more carefully.
- Slow your looking: see more of the detail.
- Slow your touching: notice more closely the sensations.
- Slow your eating: eat with more attention.
