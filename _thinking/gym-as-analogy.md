I like a good analogy. I find them helpful for getting a better grip, having a better understanding, of a topic. I think that **going to the gym** is quite a good (that is: true / meaningful / helpful) analogy for a **meditation and mindfulness** practice.

Disclaimers:

- I don't go to the gym ðŸ™ˆ. But I do have a meditation and mindfulness practice.
- This analogy only works a bit, like all analogies. All models are wrong, but some are useful. The map is not the territory.

## The Gym

Going to the gym requires our own active effort and attention. We do it for more than the results and effort at the gym.

- We work out at the gym to become more fit, not to get better at working out at the gym.
- We work out at the gym to be more healthy in our life outside the gym too, not to only be more healthy while we're at the gym.
- We work out at the gym, we don't stay at home and read books about working out.
- We go to the gym and work out, we don't just stand still for an hour.
- When we're new, or learning a new routine or machine, we ask someone for help and guidance.

## The Practice

Practing meditation and mindfulness requires our own active effort and attention. We do it for more than the results and effort of sitting.

- We meditate to become better versions of ourselves, not to get better at meditating.
- We meditate to be more mentally healthy when we're not meditating, not to only be more mentally healthy while we're meditating.
- We practice mindfulness, we don't just read books about being mindful.
- We meditate when we sit, we don't just sit there and let our mind wander.
- When we're new, or learning something new, we ask someone for help and guidance.
