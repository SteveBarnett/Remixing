- To engage our differences is to engage our judgments and stories. This creates barriers between us, making listening much harder.
- We have the same basic values, but/and the harmony that includes our differences and diversity is deeper and more durable than the one that doesn’t.
- Listen by letting go and receiving. Listening is the best tool to open into togetherness.
	- Listening does not mean agreement; keeping that clear improves our listening.
- Sameness smooths and calms, difference injects energy and movement.
- Skilful inclusion of our differences is difficult. Working with differences overrides our deepest protective habits. It requires more of a world-centric view than ethnocentric or egocentric.
- Resolving a conflict creatively is an exercise in growth, but/and we can develop a taste for working with this disruptive energy.
- It is vitally important that if we have a want or need when expressing our differences, we make a simple request.

## Judgements

- To engage our differences is to engage our judgments.
- When our attention narrows like this, we find ourselves trapped in the one perspective that makes us feel the safest: “I’m right and you’re wrong.”
- What story do I tell myself about my role in the conflict?
- Our judgments create barriers between us. These become little fences of difference that make the open field of genuine listening much harder to enter.

## Unity

- The harmony that includes our differences is deeper and more durable than the one that doesn’t.
- Our deepest nature is the unity that includes diversity.
- We can see that we have the same basic values, and together, we have more of those values.

## Listening

- Listening is the best tool there is to lower anxiety, diminish division, and open into sameness, into togetherness.
- Listening is an act of emptying out and receiving. It is simply letting go and for a moment becoming one with another point of view.
- Listening does not mean agreement. If you can keep that clear, your listening will improve.

## Energy

- In an exchange that unsettles or agitates us, for instance, we can smooth things out by creating more sameness.
- When discussions become sluggish, flat, or uninspiring, we can inject a dose of difference.

## Skillful

- Including differences in conversation, allowing them to energize and provoke us, but not to alienate us, requires a lot of skill.
- When we lean toward conflict, we are literally overriding our oldest, deepest protective habits.

## Stages

- It wouldn’t occur to the fundamentally egocentric person to work on relationship skills because such a person doesn’t have the free attention to tune into another viewpoint.
- There is an excitement in the move from ethnocentric to world-centric because difference is no longer frightening. It is stimulating.
- At this stage, exploring differences appears necessary and compelling.

## Growth

- If we are able to work with the tension of difference, we become confident in our ability to discuss and integrate ways in which we are not the same.
- It is vitally important that if we have a want or need when expressing our differences, we make a simple request.
- We can develop a taste for working with the disruptive energy.
- Resolving a conflict creatively is an exercise in growth.
