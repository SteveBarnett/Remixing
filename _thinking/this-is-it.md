This is it.

Drop the idea, the belief, that "this isn't it." Or that "this is too much." Or that "this is not enough."

This is it. This moment, this life, as it is, is enough.

## From older notes

- "This isn't it" is just a thought. A seductive, hypnotic, one! But just a thought. Notice that.
- Let go of the belief that "this isn't it."
- Waking up is a falling away of the persistent belief that this isn't it.
- "Just being alive is enough" – Suzuki Roshi
- It is a rare gift to simply meet with openness and clarity what life brings our way… We have the very mistaken belief that it’s simply not enough.
- Life, as it is, is enough.
- Once we realize that we already have more than enough conditions to be happy, we can be happy right here and right now.
- This moment, as it is, is good enough.
