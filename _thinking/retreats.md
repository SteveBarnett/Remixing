#### Guided sit notes

If you'd like some guidance, we'll offer some. If you'd don't want guidance, treat the sound of my voice as one of the many sounds you can hear, without focusing on the words.

- Settle, comfortable, stable
- After 2m - breath: few deeper, then natural rhythm
	- nose, chest, belly
- After 2m - body: contact, hands, feet
	- pressure, temperature, tingling
- After 5m - lost in thought: no problem
	- come back to the breath or body
- Last few minutes: begin again

Some scattered notes:

- Settle into a comfortable posture. So you feel stable and solid.
- Take a few deeper breaths. Then let your breath settle back into its natural rhythm.
- Notice where your body is making contact with the chair or the mat.
- Now bring your attention to your anchor. That might be your breath, or part of your body, or sounds.
- Pay close attention to your anchor. Notice everything you can about it.
- When something pulls you away, just notice it. There’s no need for judgement or evaluation.
	- See if you can let whatever is there be there. No need to try and push it away. Just see if you can soften around it.
- Then, gently come back to your anchor.

### September one day

- Read Tao Te Ching

## "Study" bits

- A copy of Tao Te Ching.
- Zen poetry or koan-like things. 
- A Dharma book, usually only for a weekend-long.
	- One of the slim tomes.
- Dharma talks, audio only.

## Observations and reflections

- I like having a Theme for the retreat, to tie it all together a bit.
- Having a specific plan for post-retreat, or end-of-the-day, is helpful.
	- After the retreat ends, something that's similar in vibe. Quiet and calm. Not immediately right back into it.
- I tend to like starting with guided, then tailing off into silent.
	- But keeping some guided ones in my back pocket.
- I've just noticed that I haven't (officially (?)) incorporated art into retreats.
	- Sketching nature.

## Helpful things

- Plan and write out the schedule. Don't have to stick to it, but having it is good.
- Put away most technology.
	- Use the iPod instead of the phone for playing guided meditations / talks.
- Home [samu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samu_(Zen)) (looking after the house).
- Set interval bells if you're struggling to focus.

## Themes

- Koan(s)
- The Headless Way
- Henry Shukman and Original Love, Original Nature
- Nondual roundtable. Sam Harris, Adyashanti, Jayasāra, Jitindriyā, Loch Kelly, John Astin, Diana Winston, more.
- Retreatvening: an evening-long retreat.
	- Start immediately after work.
	- It's a (')treat!
- Precepts, a Precept.
