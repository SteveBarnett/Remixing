- Zen poetry or koan-like things. 
- A Dharma book, usually only for a weekend-long.
	- One of the slim tomes.
- Dharma talks, audio only.

## Observations and reflections

- I like having a Theme for the retreat, to tie it all together a bit.
- Having a specific plan for post-retreat, or end-of-the-day, is helpful.
	- After the retreat ends, something that's similar in vibe. Quiet and calm. Not immediately right back into it.
- I tend to like starting with guided, then tailing off into silent.
	- But keeping some guided ones in my back pocket.
- I've just noticed that I haven't (officially (?)) incorporated art into retreats.
	- Sketching nature.

## Themes

- Koan(s)
- The Headless Way
- Henry Shukman and Original Love, Original Nature
- Nondual roundtable. Sam Harris, Adyashanti, Jayasāra, Jitindriyā, Loch Kelly, John Astin, Diana Winston, more.
- Retreatvening: an evening-long retreat.
	- Start immediately after work.
	- It's a (')treat!
- Precepts, a Precept.
