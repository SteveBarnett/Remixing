On the recommendation from a friend, I watched [How to Actually Find Love in 2025 / The Science of Swiping Right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ7ThhoWoOE) with [Logan Ury](https://www.loganury.com/) (Director of Relationship Science at [Hinge](https://hinge.co/)). I found it quite fascinating. Some of it was weird, and some of it rang true.

The weird bits:

- A very traditional framing, in particular staying firmly on The Relationship Escalator (rather than flexibility, customisability, context-sensitivity, working with dynamic and changing preferences)
- A framing as a partner fixing a lack, adding something that's missing (rather than as an optional enhancement)
- Accepting, and even finding ways to fake, traditional gender roles (rather than working with how specific people are, working through our issues about the roles)

The great bits:

- Fuck the spark, watch for the slow burn instead
    - How you me(e)t doesn't matter in the long run
- To be clear on what you're looking for, ask: how do you want someone to make you feel?
    - (There's a little crossover here, I think, with Love Languages and self-esteem)
- Great relationships are built not discovered

## Nope

I made some notes on [Nope](/thinking/nope/) the other day. Although that was prompted by thinking about being a recovering Perfectionist, that angle is also how I try to come at relationships and using apps, including dating and social media and adjacent. 

- Questioning society's scripts and norms and rules
- Finding escapes and tricks for avoiding the most problematic ones
- Being guided by an inner compass, a core set of values

I like the Cynic's emotive and evocative phrasing: deface the currency. And the Buddhist, especially Zen, approach of openness: have a don't-know mind.

This is what [the Practice part of MAP](/thinking/map/#practice) is about and my ongoing remixing of [Valued Action](/themes/2025/#valued-action-pock).
