## Blurb for meetup

In this session we'll be discussing some ways to deal with conflict from the Zen tradition. In particular, we'll go through some ideas from ["The Zen of You and Me: A Guide to Getting Along with Just About Anyone"](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6983887.Diane_Musho_Hamilton) by [Diane Musho Hamilton](https://www.dianemushohamilton.com/about-diane/). We'll cover preparing, listening, and practice applying the tools and techniques to a conflict in our own lives. 

## What's on top?

**What's on top?** Your name, and what's top of mind for you.

## Introduction

- About this time last year, I was in a job where there was a lot of conflict
- Conflict makes me intensely uncomfortable
- Having already poked around a fair in the psychological side of things (there are lots! NVC is a personal favourite), I decided to dig into a dharma approach
- I read, and found very useful, ["The Zen of You and Me: A Guide to Getting Along with Just About Anyone"](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6983887.Diane_Musho_Hamilton) by [Diane Musho Hamilton](https://www.dianemushohamilton.com/about-diane/)
    - She's an author, award-winning mediator, and Soto Zen teacher
    - She's been meditating for more than 35 years
    - She has decades experience with conflict resolution
    - She often says that ‚Äúmediate‚Äù and ‚Äúmeditate‚Äù, share the same purpose: to bring what is divided or in dispute into harmony
- There's also a recently released series "Resolving Conflict" by her on the Waking Up app

### Tinytation üßò‚è±Ô∏è

- Bring to mind some conflict that you're experiencing now, or have done recently
- Something on the lighter side, not something traumatic
- As we go through the session, I'll prompt you to bring that situation to mind

## Five steps
 
1. **Prepare.**  Thinking ahead gives us a chance to calm down, prepare to listen, and clarify what we want to say. Preparing will also help us listen better.
2. **Listen.** Don‚Äôt mix listening with problem solving or negotiating. Wait until both of you have heard each other out to start the next step. Listening does not mean agreement. If you can keep that clear, your listening will improve.
3. **Share Your Perspective.** The use of the third person asserts a truth and invites disagreement. The first person expresses a relative perspective and is easier to hear because it doesn‚Äôt claim the position of truth. Including our feeling states humanizes our communication and helps bring the heart online.
4. **Relax and wait.**
5. **Problem solve.** Skillful negotiation involves seeing where our wants and needs overlap.

We'll talk mostly about 1 and 2 in this session.

## Unity

- Our deepest nature is the unity that includes diversity
- The harmony that includes our differences is deeper and more durable
- We have the same basic values and needs
    - For example, from Maslow: food, water, warmth, rest; safety, security; relationships, friendships
- This means taking a world-centric view, not an ethnocentric one, or an egocentric one

## Difficulty and growth

- (Simple but not easy)
- Skilful inclusion of our differences is difficult
- Resolving conflict is an exercise is growth
- Working with differences overrides our deepest protective habits
- Over time, we can develop a taste for it
- When we can work with the tension, we become confident in our ability to discuss and integrate ways in which we are not the same

## 1. Prepare

- Meditation and mindfulness is deliberate and focused, yet relaxed
- If we want to change, we have to notice what happens to us in stressful situations
- What story am I telling myself about my role in this?
- Remember to relate to emotions as states
    - An experience of thought, mood, body

### Emotions

- Emotions can be a powerful source of information
- Feel them completely, then let them go entirely
- Don't stay trapped in them
- Notice that your heart is big enough to include things that get you down **and** things that lift you up

### Tinytation üßò‚è±Ô∏è

- Bring to mind the conflict you thought of at the start of the session
- What story are you telling yourself about your role?
- What can you notice about what's happening to you? Body sensations, emotions.

## 2. Listen

- Listening is the best tool to open into togetherness
- It can help lower anxiety, diminish division, and open into sameness
- Listen by letting go of your reactivity
- Empty out, receive
- For a moment, become one with another point of view
- This isn't agreement, just listening
    - Keeping this clear can help us listen better

### Barriers to listening

- Judgements and stories make barriers
- Barriers make listening harder
- A narrow perspective of "I'm right, you're wrong" makes us feel safest

### Tinytation üßò‚è±Ô∏è

- Bring to mind the conflict you thought of at the start of the session
- See if you can empty out a little, and just receive, just listen to them
- You don't have to agree, just listen
- Now flip it. Imagine that they are listening to you. Really listening, intently.
    - Notice how it feels to be heard

## Growth

- Resolving a conflict is an exercise in growth
- Engaging differences is engaging judgement, stories

## 5. Problem solve, briefly

- It's vitally important that needs are expressed as a simple request
- Sameness smooths and calms
- Difference injects energy and movement

## Meditation üßò

- For the closing meditation, try and let go of the conflict entirely
- Let go of the story you've been telling yourself
    - About yourself, about them
- Let go of the emotions you've been feeling about it 
    - They'll come back, you don't need to hold on to them
