## Exported Highlights

### Welcome to Japan

- What unites the range of climates, geographies and outlooks are the rhythms of the seasons, to which the heart of the country still beats, dictating the ever-shifting weather, cuisine and cultural life of the country’s 127 million inhabitants
- informally grouped into eight different regions
- Mainland Japan is typically defined as the five largest islands in the archipelago: Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and Okinawa
- Autumn  the weather in October, November and even early December is still magical – warm by day, cool at night, and largely dry and sunny
- Winter  From December through February, the temperature in many parts of Japan significantly cools, and people turn to warming seasonal foods like stews, curries, and one-pot dishes such as oden to keep out the chill

#### First Encounters

- understand the importance of good manners
- However, if you’re in a small town in the countryside, finding your destination can be a whole new challenge. Not all streets have names, and buildings within a block may be numbered in the order that they were built – intriguing but confusing. If in doubt, ask a policeman
- In Tokyo, 20 million train passengers pass through the network every day. This leads to an incredibly busy commuter rush hour – an experience to be braved or avoided, depending on your point of view
- Money In Japan, money is rarely passed directly from hand to hand, so when paying for an item or service, place your money on the small tray provided. Tipping is not part of the culture and if you leave money for a server they’ll always return
- Chopsticks Never point your chopsticks at another person, wave them in the air, or use them to spear food. And you should never leave your chopsticks sticking into a bowl of rice, as this is reminiscent of funeral rituals
- Bathrooms When you enter a bathroom in a house or ryokan (traditional inn), there will often be a pair of slippers at the door; leave your own footwear outside and switch to the these
- Shoes Anywhere there are tatami mats – and always in a person’s home – you will need to take off your shoes, to avoid bringing in dirt from outside, so best wear clean matching socks at all times.
- Bowing When meeting someone for the first time, it is polite to bow as a sign of respect. You can also bow when thanking someone or saying goodbye
- Accept the card using both hands, and present your own if you have it on you. It’s important to make sure you treat their card with respect and do not jam it in your pocket, but instead slip it carefully into your wallet.
- many Japanese people will have studied it at school, and will love the chance to practise
- If you have time to pick up a few useful Japanese phrases before your trip, all well and good but, if not, you’ll still get by just fine. You don’t have to speak the language to communicate: respectful behaviour and good manners will go a long way.
- maneki-neko (beckoning cat)
- Cross the threshold into the world of the gods at a Shinto shrine

country’s varied climates have created distinct local cultures
- **rural folklore of the Tono Valley in Iwate**

#### Cityscapes

- **Yokohama** - So watery bitty!
- **Osaka - with a reputation for being more direct and outgoing than any other Japanese**
- **Nagoyans, however, take more pride in their food than business savvy**
- Tokyo - classical gardens, historic temples, quiet riverbanks and traditional neighbourhoods like Shibamata, Yanaka and Nezu
- "the big five - Travelling to Japan’s most populous cities will fully immerse you in Japanese life, providing the perfect introduction to the country’s culture.
- Yokohama - lively bay area
- The capital of Hokkaido in Japan’s north, Sapporo is the most distinctive of the big five
- Beyond the sprawling mass of metropolises like Tokyo and Osaka, Japan’s smaller cities offer very different urban experiences. More mellow and less densely packed, they’re full of local flavour and history.
- **Kanazawa is often referred to as “Little Kyoto”. Known for its gourmet seafood, the city is connected to Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto by direct train, but still doesn’t get huge numbers of tourists **
- **Located on Shikoku, the smallest of Japan’s four main islands, Matsuyama is a fine example of a city that balances past and present. The largest and most cosmopolitan of Shikoku’s cities, it has a skyline dominated by a hilltop castle and its streets still employ a network of rickety old trams**
- Naha has a laid-back island vibe, and it makes a great jumping-off point to explore the stunning Okinawan island chains.

#### Island Diversity

- Looking north to the Sea of Japan, Sado Island off the coast of Niigata and the four Oki Islands off Shimane are all rugged and windswept northern isles that were once places of exile 
- The area known as mainland Japan is actually comprised of five large islands – Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and Okinawa – while around these are small island groups like the Oki, Izu, Ogasawara, and Yaeyama islands. Take a trip to these outer reaches and you will be rewarded with a broader and deeper experience of Japan. 
- Island Diversity - From windswept to subtropical
- The islands of Okinawa are similarly stunning, with the subtropical Yaeyamas in particular standing out for their incredible diversity
- Sun-kissed Retreats - Technically still in Tokyo Prefecture, the 30 small Ogasawara Islands 1,000 km (600 miles) south of mainland Tokyo are well worth the 24-hour ferry trip.
