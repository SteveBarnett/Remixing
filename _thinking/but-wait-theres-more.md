Meditation helps us notice more.

- Especially in the beginning, it can seem like there are more thoughts than there were before.
	- This can feel a bit... well, depressing. And because humans have a negativity bias, it can seem like there are more sad, bad, and dangerous to know thoughts. Argh!
- But. Actually. We're just **noticing** more thoughts, rather than being caught up in them.
- One trick to it, the thing I am still working on, is noticing the good stuff too.
- Another, deeper, extra, trick is noticing something else, something a bit different. Understanding that the good and the bad thoughts all exist in a wider context.
	- One way of describing this that I like is that we are the context of consciousness, not the contents. We are not our thoughts. We are the space that thoughts arise (and pass away) in.
