<ul>
	<li>Follow the path up your body. Notice it fades out into open space.
		<ul>
			<li>Look for your head. Are <strong>you</strong> behind something? Is that what you <strong>see</strong>?</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Your true nature is boundless, open, space.</li>
			<ul>				
				<li>The space says yes to everything.</li>
			</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Anything you perceive reveals itself in this empty, still, space.
			<ul>
				<li>Everything you can perceive appears in your field of perception.</li>
				<li>Can you see anything that's not in your field of vision?</li>
				<li>The world is in you.
			</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Can you find any gaps between perceptions?
		<ul>
			<li>Between movement and stillness?</li>
			<li>Between sounds and silence?</li>
			<li>Between and not-seen?</li>
		</ul>
</ul>
