## Gathered notes

High-level important signposts / reminders

- The central paradox of self-compassion: we give ourselves compassion not to feel better but because we feel bad
- Touch is a hack that can change our physiological responses more quickly than our thoughts
- The quintessential self-compassion question is ‚ÄúWhat do I need?"
- Common humanity allows us to balance our needs with those of others
- Let the inner critic feel heard: it's trying to keep you safe
- Consider the short-term benefits of your resistance. Consider the long-term costs of your resistance.
- Most of our self-improvement strategies eventually fail because they‚Äôre based on resistance rather than acceptance

### Stress

- Modern life has stressors that keep our threat-defense system (the fight/flight/freeze response) turned on more than its turned off.
- The threat-defense system evolved primarily for self-preservation. The care system evolved primarily for other-preservation. So it feels more natural to criticize ourselves and be compassionate to others.
    -  One reason we criticize ourselves for being burned out or inadequate is that it gives us the illusion of control.

### Self-compassion

- **The central paradox of self-compassion: we give ourselves compassion not to feel better but because we feel bad.**
- **The three core components of self-compassion‚Äîmindfulness, common humanity, and self-kindness**
- Self-compassion has two main expressions: tender acceptance and fierce action.
- Tender self-compassion focuses more on how we're relating to it that what's happening.
    - Offer yourself comfort, soothing, and validation.
    - **Touch is a hack that can change our physiological responses more quickly than our thoughts.**
- Explore just a bit beyond your comfort zone.
- Anger can be constructive or destructive, depending on whether it prevents or causes harm.
- Choose integrity over pleasing others.
- Compassion reflects the desire to alleviate suffering. Therefore, **the quintessential self-compassion question is ‚ÄúWhat do I need?‚Äù**
    - See [Nonviolent communication - needs list](/thinking/nonviolent-communication-needs-list/)
    - Physical, mental and emotional, relational
- **Needs and values go hand in hand. Meeting our needs allows us to survive, and living in accord with our core values makes life worth living.**
- **Common humanity allows us to balance our needs with those of others.**
- Self-compassion focuses on the alleviation of suffering.
    - **Make changes to be happy, not because we're inadequate.**
- Loving-kindness is an expression of care. Self-compassion is caring specifically for suffering.
- Becoming a Compassionate Mess: when we feel like a mess (that is, fully human!) our goal is to bring compassion to it.
- **The most devastating effect of burnout is not the pain of exhaustion and depletion but the loss of enjoyment in life.**

#### Backdraft

- Backdraft: when self-compassion feels bad. We notice things by contrast: the love goes in and the pain comes out.
    - The feelings are being uncovered by self-compassion, not caused by it. It's revealing what needs healing.
- The more you care, the more vulnerable you are to burnout.

### Perfectionism

- **Letting go of the illusion of control is also a game changer, especially for those with the personality trait of perfectionism.**
- Perfectionism can lead to an obsessive focus on detail and the desire to control every aspect.
- **Even when you do everything right, perfectionism leaves you unhappy and dissatisfied with your achievements.**
- **Perfectionist feel good about themselves when they meet their high standards and bad they don't.**
    - **With self-compassion our sense of self-worth isn‚Äôt contingent on success or failure; it‚Äôs rooted in being a flawed human being doing the best we can in the moment.**
- **Acknowledge that sometimes, try as we might, we come up short.**
- **Perfectionism (never good enough) ... can be interpreted as an effort to convince ourselves or others that we‚Äôre valuable and worthy.**

#### Inner Critic

- **The inner critic is simply trying to keep us safe.**
    - If you try to shut it down, it will just scream louder.
    - When the inner critic feels heard it doesn‚Äôt have to shout so loudly.
- Harsh self-criticism activates the threat-defense system.
- When we criticize ourselves for being burned out, we just end up feeling more wiped out and more burned out.

#### Positive

- Positive psychology emphasises the need to intentionally cultivate positive thoughts and emotions to counteract the negativity bias.
- We need to acknowledge our gifts as well as our deficits to view our capabilities clearly and accurately.
    - Humility that refuses to recognize our good qualities is as false as arrogance that refuses to recognize our shortcomings.
    - How we relate to ourselves in our own minds and hearts, not necessarily what we say to others.
- We‚Äôre more effective at overcoming burnout when we choose coping strategies that are in line with our personal strengths.

### Acceptance

- **Pretending you‚Äôre not overwhelmed will ensure you remain overwhelmed.**
- **Consider the short-term benefits of your resistance. Consider the long-term costs of your resistance.**
- Mindfulness asks, ‚ÄúWhat am I experiencing right now?‚Äù Self-compassion adds, ‚ÄúWhat do I need right now?‚Äù
    - Using it to try and avoid or get rid of feelings is just another form of resistance.
- **Dealing with pain by numbing it, distracting ourselves, or avoiding it is only a temporary fix.**
- **Being at the end of the rope highlights we're out of options.**
- **Most of our self-improvement strategies eventually fail because they‚Äôre based on resistance rather than acceptance.**

### 5 Your Body Knows

#### The Physiology of Stress

- the sympathetic nervous system, otherwise known as the threat-defense system.
- the fight/flight/freeze response

#### Stress in Modern Life

- Problems build, however, when instead of a one-and-done event, multiple stressors come at us all day long. The system becomes hypervigilant and starts kicking in unnecessarily.
- This means our threat-defense system is turned on more than it‚Äôs turned off.

#### The Care System to the Rescue

- The care system (sometimes called the attachment system) refers to the mental and emotional bonds that arise when we care for others or are cared for by others.
- It also stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, often known as the rest-and-digest system, which counteracts sympathetic arousal.
- The threat-defense system evolved primarily for self-preservation, and the care system evolved primarily for other-preservation. That‚Äôs why it feels more natural to criticize ourselves and be compassionate to others.
- Research shows that self-compassion activates the parasympathetic nervous system (linked to the care system) and deactivates the sympathetic nervous system (linked to the threat-defense system).
- There‚Äôs a hack we can use: physical touch. The body is closely wired to our autonomic nervous system
and can change our physiological responses more quickly than our thoughts.

### 6 Warming Up the Conversation

#### Warming Things Up

- Self-compassion has two main expressions: tender acceptance and fierce action.
- Tender self-compassion promotes resilience and recovery, which is exactly what we need when we‚Äôreburned out.

#### How Are You Relating to Yourself?

- Importantly, with tender self-compassion we focus less on what‚Äôs happening and more on how we‚Äôre relating to what‚Äôs happening.
- Our attention shifts from the content of our experience to the quality of how we‚Äôre holding it.

#### Try a Little Tenderness

- Tender self-compassion can help you heal from burnout by offering yourself comfort, soothing, and
validation.
    - Comfort means responding to our emotional needs in a compassionate manner. What emotions are you feeling? Hurt? Fear? Loneliness? Shame? And what do you need when you feel like that? If you feel sad, maybe you need to listen to some music or walk in the woods? If you‚Äôre frightened, maybe you need to talk with a friend? Comfort usually has a tender quality. Think of how you respond to a close colleague who is really upset by a traumatic work experience. You probably say something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry. Are you okay? I‚Äôm right here for you.‚Äù When you‚Äôre distressed because you‚Äôre burned out, what words of comfort can you offer yourself? Sometimes a warm nod of recognition is all that‚Äôs needed.
    - Soothing refers to our physical needs‚Äîquieting the overstressed body. When you‚Äôre burned out, your body has probably been pushed to the limit, not just by exhaustion on the job but also from not eating or sleeping well. To soothe yourself physically, you might want to take a rest, settle into a warm bath, get a massage, or drink a cup of tea. You can also give yourself supportive touch (see Chapter 5), such as tenderly placing a hand over your heart or another body part that is holding stress. Validation is the process of understanding and honoring the pain of burnout. It‚Äôs relational, and in the case of self- compassion, it‚Äôs how we relate to ourselves. We often subtly assume that we shouldn‚Äôt feel so exhausted; that there‚Äôs something wrong with us for feeling this way.
    - Validating the pain acknowledges that you‚Äôre struggling and that you‚Äôre fully human for doing so. Of course you‚Äôre burned out given everything you‚Äôve been dealing with. Anyone would feel this way in similar circumstances. It‚Äôs important to recognize and name your distress in a caring way to begin to work with it.

#### We‚Äôre All Doing the Best We Can

- One reason we criticize ourselves for being burned out or inadequate is that it gives us the illusion of control.

#### Loving, Connected Presence

- The three core components of self-compassion‚Äîmindfulness, common humanity, and self-kindness‚Äî take a particular form when used to alleviate suffering through tender acceptance: loving, connected presence.

#### Common Humanity: Feeling Connected to Others

- Stress is the norm, not the exception.
- More interconnected causes and conditions exist than you could possibly identify.

#### Self-Compassion Tool 6 Tender Self-Compassion Break

- ‚ÄúThis is a moment of suffering.‚Äù
- We can be warm and kind to ourselves simply because of the state we‚Äôre in, without preconditions.
    - `Can I?`

### 7 When Self-Compassion Feels Bad

#### Working with Backdraft

- When we practice self-compassion and the door of the heart opens, the love goes in and the pain comes out.
- These feelings are not caused by self-compassion; they‚Äôre being uncovered. That‚Äôs a good thing because you can see them and begin to heal them.
- Why does backdraft occur? Because we can only know anything through contrast. We know hot because we know cold. We know light because we also know dark.

#### Recognizing Backdraft

- What gets in the way of your being more self-compassionate? What thoughts and feelings are you afraid might come up?

#### Backdraft is Part of the Healing Process

- Backdraft is a sign that self-compassion is working. It puts you in touch with those areas in yourself
that need healing,

#### A Word about Safety

- The ideal balance for self-compassion practice is to feel challenged but to explore just a bit beyond your comfort zone.

#### How to Work With Backdraft

- You can‚Äôt meditate all day long, so what you do in your life is the best indication of how self- compassionate you are.
- when we perform ordinary acts of self-care as a response to suffering‚Äîwith behaviors like listening to music, gardening, or talking with friends‚Äîself-care becomes self-compassion.

### 8 Putting Things in Perspective

#### Mindful Awareness

- Mindfulness, the foundation of self-compassion, can help us gain clarity and perspective.
- Mindfulness disentangles us from painful thoughts and emotions by giving us a little distance from them.
- Mindfulness helps us become aware of our distress with balance and clarity so we aren‚Äôt so overwhelmed by it.

#### Direct Awareness

- Mindfulness provides clarity by allowing us to be directly aware of our experience rather than filtering it through the lens of thought.

#### It‚Äôs the Default Mode Network

- research shows that the more we practice mindfulness, the less we‚Äôre trapped in the default mode.
- We give the mind something to do so it doesn‚Äôt wander off into doom and gloom.

> Self-Compassion Tool 8 Affectionate Breathing

### 9 Resistance is Futile

#### How Fighting Burnout Makes It Worse

- Pretending you‚Äôre not overwhelmed will ensure that you remain overwhelmed.

#### Compassion Rather than Resistance

- Mindfulness asks, ‚ÄúWhat am I experiencing right now?‚Äù Self-compassion adds, ‚ÄúWhat do I need right now?‚Äù

#### The Paradox of Self-Compassion

- the central paradox of self-compassion: we give ourselves compassion not to feel better but because we feel bad.

- If we try to use self-compassion as a slick new way of getting rid of what we‚Äôre feeling in the moment, it‚Äô s just resistance in another form.

#### Self-Compassion Tool 9 Reducing Resistance to Work-Related Stress

- Think of the short-term benefits that your resistance may be offering you
- Consider the long-term costs of your resistance.

### 10 Facing the Storm

#### Working with the Difficult Emotions of Burnout

- remaining open and vulnerable to our pain feels unbearable.
- Dealing with emotional pain by numbing it, distracting ourselves, or becoming resigned cynics is only a temporary fix.
- being at the end of our rope in a state of burnout can also be a gift, because it highlights the fact that we‚Äôve run out of escape routes.

#### Approaching Difficult Emotions with a Strong Back and Soft Front

- Joan Halifax, a Buddhist meditation teacher and writer, says that when fear is powering our reactions, we typically adopt a hard front (the critical cynic) to hide a weak back (lack of confidence that we can survive). She proposes that we turn this around when things get difficult, aiming instead to cultivate a strong back but a soft front.

- The Five Stages of Acceptance
    - Resisting
    - Exploring
    - Tolerating
    - Allowing
    - Befriending

#### Strategies for Opening to Difficult Emotions Related to Burnout

- Labeling emotions
- Feeling emotions in the body
- Soften‚Äìsoothe‚Äìallow
    - Softening‚Äîphysical compassion
    - Soothing‚Äîemotional compassion
    - Allowing‚Äîmental compassion

#### Self-Compassion Tool 10 Being with Difficult Emotions Related to Burnout

- When we use a soft front and strong back to stay with the discomfort of difficult emotions, they tend to arise, do their little dance, then move on.

### 11 Stopping the Drain

#### Reducing Empathy Fatigue

- the more you care, the more vulnerable you are to burnout.
- Self-compassion is needed to stop the drain. Without offering yourself support, kindness, and comfort, you can‚Äôt expect to go on like this forever.

#### Compassion Versus Empathy

- Compassion generates feelings of warmth and connection that are energizing and provide a buffer against the negative effects of empathic pain.
- When we feel compassion toward others who are suffering, we‚Äôre less overwhelmed by their pain. First, kindness is a positive, fulfilling emotion that can replenish us and provide resources to cope.
- Importantly, to counter the draining effects of empathy fatigue, compassion needs to be directed both outward and inward.

#### Putting on Your Own Oxygen Mask First

- while we‚Äôre experiencing empathic pain, we can direct compassion toward ourselves.
- caring for others is a challenging but rewarding aspect of the human experience:

#### Self-Compassion and Equanimity

- When we criticize ourselves as caregivers, there‚Äôs often an implicit agenda of control. We want to alleviate or eliminate the other person‚Äôs suffering and feel we should be able to do so.

#### Self-Compassion Tool 11 Compassion with Equanimity

- I am not the cause of this person‚Äôs suffering, nor is it entirely within my power to make it go away, even though I wish I could.
- Letting go of the illusion of control is also a game changer, especially for those with the personality trait of perfectionism.

### 12 When Good Isn‚Äôt Good Enough

#### Avoiding the Perfectionism Sinkhole

- When we judge our worth by our productivity and expect ourselves to be perfect, being a flawed human becomes a problem. Human beings (by definition) are imperfect, so perfectionism (by definition) is unachievable.
- If it‚Äôs not okay to fail, make mistakes, or achieve less than we‚Äôre aiming for, we will never be at rest.

#### How Perfectionism Contributes to Burnout

- Research shows that if you‚Äôre a perfectionist, you‚Äôre vulnerable to burnout for several reasons.
- you‚Äôre highly committed to whatever you put your mind to.
- When you have unrealistically high standards, the pressure to meet self-imposed demands mentally drains you too.
- Perfectionism can lead to an obsessive focus on detail and the desire to control every aspect of one‚Äôs work.
- even when you do everything right, perfectionism leaves you unhappy and dissatisfied with your achievements.
- You may call yourself names and say mean things that you would never say to someone you cared about.
- Harsh self-criticism activates the fight/flight/freeze response, which generates additional physiological and psychological stress
- perfectionists suffer from fear of failure. If you don‚Äôt accept failure of any kind, the very thought of potentially failing can send shivers down your spine. This creates constant worry that never abates.

#### Perfectionism and Self-Worth

- contingent self-esteem, meaning our sense of self-worth depends on achievement in those areas of life that are important to our identity.
- if you‚Äôre a perfectionist, you will feel good about yourself when you meet your high standards and bad about yourself when you don‚Äôt.
- With self-compassion our sense of self-worth isn‚Äôt contingent on success or failure; it‚Äôs rooted in being a flawed human being doing the best we can in the moment.

#### Does Self-Compassion Lower Your Standards?

- Being kind to yourself doesn‚Äôt mean letting your standards slip; it simply means you have more resources available to meet them.

#### Giving Yourself Compassion for Being a Perfectionist

- it‚Äôs important to be kind to yourself for striving so hard.

#### Self-Compassion Tool 12 Letting Go of the Need to Be Perfect

- What are you afraid might happen to you?
- Self-compassion allows us to embrace our imperfections and realize that our flawed humanity is what connects us to others.

### 13 Why We Beat Ourselves Up

#### Understanding the Inner Critic

- when we criticize ourselves for being burned out, we just end up feeling more wiped out and more burned out.
- We think self-criticism helps motivate us to improve. In fact, research shows that the biggest block to self-compassion is the belief it will undermine our motivation.
- It is also directly tied to shame, depression, and suicidal ideation

####  A Ploy for Safety

- The underlying intent of our inner critic is a good one: it‚Äôs simply trying to keep us safe.
- The inner critic stands tall, with complete certitude of being correct. It feels better to say we should have gotten it right‚Äîwhich presumes that we could have gotten it right if we had tried hard enough‚Äîthan to acknowledge that sometimes, try as we might, we come up short.

#### The Inner Critic Has a Role to Play

- the inner critic is playing an important role: it perceives a danger and is trying to warn you about it. If
you try to shut it down, it will just scream louder.
- internal family systems (IFS)

#### Listening to Our Compassionate Self

- We need to step out of our immature parts so that we aren‚Äôt limited by their simplistic perspectives.
- Our inner critic then feels heard and doesn‚Äôt have to shout so loudly to warn us of danger.

> Self-Compassion Tool 13 Finding Your Compassionate Voice

### 14 Doing Something About It

#### Fierce Self-Compassion in Action

- When we accept ourselves and validate our feelings of exhaustion and hopelessness, healing can begin.
- To alleviate suffering, we must focus on improving the circumstances of our lives and fix what‚Äôs broken on the outside as well as inside.

####  Finding Our Inner Mama Bear

- Fierce self-compassion is about taking action to protect ourselves, provide for our needs, and motivate change.

#### Anger as an Energizing Ally

- Anger can be constructive or destructive, depending on whether it prevents or causes harm.

#### Fierce Self-Compassion in Action

- If we look at the three components of self-compassion in their fierce protective form, they are expressed as brave, empowered clarity.

> Self-Compassion Tool 14 Protective Self-Compassion Break

### 15 Drawing a Line in the Sand

#### Learning How to Say No

- It can be hard to disentangle one‚Äôs sense of self-worth from being helpful or, in other words, compliant.

#### Why We Have Trouble Saying No

- Reluctance to say no may come from societal norms, the reactions of others, or our image of ourselves‚Äî sometimes a combination of all three.

#### ‚ÄôTis Better to Give than Receive

- being selfish is the worst thing you can be if you identify as a caring and giving person.
- What‚Äôs not appropriate is the message that our worth is derived only from our usefulness to others. Saying yes as an authentic choice energizes us. Saying yes because we think we‚Äôre supposed to say yes to be a good person drains us.

#### Fearing Others‚Äô Reactions

- When we are self-compassionate, we aren‚Äôt totally dependent on others‚Äô positive opinions. Our self- worth isn‚Äôt contingent on social approval. This allows us to choose integrity over pleasing others.

- Self-compassion requires wisdom when choosing how, when, where, and whether to draw boundaries so that our choice causes the least amount of suffering possible.

> Self-Compassion Tool 15 Getting Comfortable with Boundaries

### 16 Providing for Ourselves

#### What Do I Need?

- When the question about what we need defaults to what others need from us, we‚Äôre on a path to
burnout.
- When we‚Äôre not struggling, it can be uplifting to focus on the needs of others.
- Everyone benefits from kindness and generosity when it‚Äôs freely given. But we must include ourselves
in the circle of generosity

#### The Quintessential Self-Compassion Question

- Compassion reflects the desire to alleviate suffering. Therefore, the quintessential self-compassion
question is ‚ÄúWhat do I need?‚Äù
- It‚Äôs also okay not to know what you need. Simply asking the question helps us feel cared for. It validates
the truth that our needs are important and worthy of being met.
- ‚ÄúWhat do I need . . .
    - To feel safe?
    - To emotionally comfort myself? Talk with a friend?
    - To physically soothe myself?
    - To encourage myself? Read an inspiring book?
    - To provide for myself? Get some rest or eat healthy food? To take action? Make a change?
- What Are ‚ÄúNeeds‚Äù Anyway?
    - `Nvc?!`
    - physical needs,
    - mental and emotional needs, such as the need for peace of mind, mental stimulation, or joy.
        - `Maslow?`
    - relational needs, such as the need to be accepted, respected, valued, and loved.
- Wants tend to be personal rather than universal.
- Wants arise from the neck up, and needs come from the neck down.
- We can have millions of wants, like we have millions of thoughts, but our needs are relatively simple and few.

#### Why Don‚Äôt We Ask Ourselves the Question?

- A common roadblock is feeling that we aren‚Äôt worthy of getting our needs met. But like all human beings, you deserve to be happy and free from suffering.
- if you make yourself miserable by disregarding your needs, people around you will also feel miserable.
- perfectionism (never good enough), crazy ambition (never successful enough), or excessive materialism (never enough stuff) can all be interpreted as efforts to convince ourselves or others that we‚Äôre valuable and worthy.
- Research has shown, in fact, that self-compassionate people are better able to take care of others, are more adept at compromise, and are more willing to seek a win‚Äìwin solution by balancing their needs with those of others.

#### Self-Care and Self-Compassion

- How the Three Components of Self-Compassion Can Help
- When we‚Äôre kind to ourselves, we care about fulfilling our own needs.
- Common humanity allows us to balance our needs with those of others.
- Mindfulness allows us to authentically answer the question ‚ÄúWhat do I need?‚Äù It turns our attention inward, facilitating introspection.

#### Self-Compassion Tool 16: Providing Self-Compassion Break

- shift your attention to see if you can name a physical, emotional, or relational human need that lies behind your unmet need, such as the need for health, rest, ease, safety, peace, joy, or connection.
- Say to yourself with meaning, ‚ÄúThis is what I authentically need to be healthy.‚Äù Other options are ‚ÄúThis is deeply meaningful to me‚Äù and ‚ÄúThis is important to who I am.‚Äù
- Try saying to yourself, ‚ÄúAll humans have important needs, including me.‚Äù Other options are ‚ÄúWe all
have needs that are worth being met‚Äù and ‚ÄúI will honor my needs as well as those of others.‚Äù
- Try saying to yourself something like ‚ÄúI deserve to be happy and free from suffering.‚Äù Other options might be ‚ÄúI am committed to care for myself, no matter what, every day‚Äù and ‚ÄúI will do what is necessary to heal and thrive.‚Äù

### 17 Rediscovering Meaning

#### What Are My Core Values?

- Needs and values go hand in hand. Meeting our needs allows us to survive, and living in accord with our core values makes life worth living.
    - `Huh`
- Our core values provide a natural source of strength and vitality
- When our actions are at odds with our moral values, we can experience moral injury. Moral injury refers to the anguish‚Äîgrief, shame, anger, disgust‚Äîthat results when we witness or engage in behaviors that violate our own deeply held moral values.

#### Reconnecting With Our Values

- judging
    - `This is an inheritance of mine`

#### Knowing Your Core Values

- Core Values versus Social Norms
- Core values energize us; social norms often deplete us.
- Goals versus Core Values
- Goals are destinations; core values are directions.
- Interestingly, we don‚Äôt choose our core values. If we did, they would probably be infiltrated by social norms. Core values are discovered. Our lived experienced tells us what‚Äôs truly meaningful to us.
- Returning Home

#### Self-Compassion Tool 17 Discovering Your Core Values

- deserve
    - `Another, related, inheritance`

### 18 Becoming a Wise Inner Coach

#### Self-Compassionate Motivation

- Old habits die hard, however, and we‚Äôre more used to spurring ourselves forward with insult and
intimidation.

#### But Won‚Äôt You Get Soft?

- Self-compassion focuses on the alleviation of suffering.

#### Inspiration Rather than Insults

- being screamed at doesn‚Äôt motivate players to improve in the long run, if at all; it just gives them a shot of adrenaline so they can escape the coach‚Äôs now-terrifying wrath.
- It also makes it harder for us to learn from our mistakes:
- Other studies show that self-compassionate people tend to have a growth mindset rather than a fixed mindset.

#### Motivating Ourselves Using the Three Components of Self-Compassion

- The desire to alleviate our suffering drives us to make changes in our lives not because we‚Äôre inadequate as we are, but because we care about ourselves and want to be happy. When we use fierce self- compassion for motivation, we experience encouraging, wise vision.
- Our sense of our common humanity takes shape as wisdom when we try to motivate change. We recognize that being human means making mistakes, getting it wrong, failing, and getting stuck.
- When we forget our humanity, we unconsciously believe that we shouldn‚Äôt struggle and that there‚Äôs something wrong with us when we do.
- By framing our experience in the larger context of what it means to be human, we gain insight and knowledge that helps us move forward.
- Mindfulness provides focus and vision when we‚Äôre trying to recover from burnout.

#### Self-Compassion Tool 18 Motivating Self-Compassion Break

- ‚ÄúThis is what I want for myself.‚Äù Other options are ‚ÄúThis goal is important to me‚Äù and ‚ÄúThis would bring me happiness.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúLearning from failure is part of being human.‚Äù Other options include ‚ÄúWe usually get it wrong before we get it right‚Äù and ‚ÄúGrowth is usually slow and messy.‚Äù
- In traditional Buddhist meditation practice, the practice of goodwill is referred to as loving-kindness practice.

### 19 Goodwill, Not Good Feelings

#### Cultivating Loving-Kindness

- instead of saying ‚ÄúI am [fill in the blank]‚Äù as a way to manifest the desired state, which potentially sets up an argument with the truth, we say ‚ÄúMay I [fill in the blank]‚Äù to express our positive intentions for
ourselves.
- We repeat loving-kindness phrases to cultivate benevolent intentions rather than particular mood
states.

#### The Difference between Loving-Kindness and Self-Compassion

- Loving-kindness and self-compassion are two sides of the same coin. Both are expressions of warmth and care, but self-compassion specifically refers to caring in the midst of suffering (passion in Latin means ‚Äúsuffering‚Äù). Loving-kindness refers to goodwill more generally and isn‚Äôt necessarily focused on suffering.
- Research shows that practicing traditional loving-kindness meditation increases self-compassion and that practicing self-compassion increases joy and happiness.

#### How Does Loving-Kindness Work?

- By setting our intention to cultivate goodwill, even if we aren‚Äôt fully feeling it, we can start to reverse things.
- When we repeat loving-kindness phrases even if we‚Äôre not feeling them, not only are we setting our intentions in the right direction, we‚Äôre also countering old habits.

#### How to Craft Loving-Kindness Phrases

- Choose phrases that feel like slipping into a warm bath or sunbathing on a beach.
- Choose phrases that don‚Äôt cause any argument in your head.

#### Self-Compassion Tool 19 Finding Loving-Kindness Phrases

- ‚ÄúWhat do I need? What do I truly need?‚Äù and allow the answer to arise naturally within you: let the answer be a universal human need that is not being met, such as the need to be ‚Äúvalued,‚Äù ‚Äúhealthy,‚Äù ‚Äúpeaceful,‚Äù ‚Äúconnected,‚Äù or ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhat do I need to hear from others? What words do I long to hear

### 20 Small Pleasures

#### Savoring the Good

- The most devastating effect of burnout is arguably not the pain of exhaustion and depletion but the loss of enjoyment in life.

#### The Negativity Bias

- Unfortunately, our brains are hardwired to pay attention to problems due to an evolutionary hand-me- down called the negativity bias.
- The truth is that life is always a balance of light and dark, but because of the negativity bias of burnout, the light often gets relegated to the shadows.

#### Enter Positive Psychology

- the positive psychology movement has emphasized the need to intentionally cultivate positive thoughts and emotions to counteract the negativity bias.
- Focusing on negative information narrows our attention on potential threats to our survival, whereas focusing on positive emotions broadens our perspective.
- This is not a case of putting on rose-colored glasses; it‚Äôs a matter of looking at the world through clear lenses again.
- Self-Compassion Creates Positive Emotions

#### Gratitude

- Gratitude is a matter of noticing and appreciating the gifts we‚Äôre given.
- When we‚Äôre grateful, we recognize the interdependence of things, dispelling the illusion that we‚Äôre separate.
- This isn‚Äôt an effort to brush off or deny the fact that your feet hurt, but it places things in a larger context.
- It doesn‚Äôt take much time but can produce a dramatic shift in your emotional outlook and energy levels.

#### Savoring

- Savoring may be called permission to enjoy. Savoring is experiential and involves consciously taking pleasure in things.
- find moments in your day to mindfully take pleasure in simple things

> Self-Compassion Tool 20 Sense and Savor Walk

### 21 Knowing Our Strengths

#### The Practice of Self-Appreciation

- We need to acknowledge our gifts as well as our deficits to view our capabilities clearly and accurately.

#### Celebrating Our Positive Qualities

- Think of self-appreciation as gratitude and savoring turned inward.

#### Why is Self-Appreciation So Difficult?
