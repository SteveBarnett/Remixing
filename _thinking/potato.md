(I wrote this a while ago, then forgot about it. But it feels useful again now!)

When thinking about my energy levels at work, I often use a battery metaphor. I've had very low energy levels in the second half of 2022.

1. At first, I thought **my battery level was low**.
2. Then I thought **my battery level was empty**.
3. Then I thought **my battery needed to be replaced**. It recharged slowly, didn’t recharge fully, and discharged quickly.
4. Now I think **my battery is a potato**. It can’t be recharged, it only supplies a small amount of energy, and… it’s a potato.

This is also a sneaky geeky reference to Portal 2 PotatOS.
