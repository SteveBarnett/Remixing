Although I can be stubborn sometimes, I can also give up very easily sometimes. Hence "The Capitulater". Especially when

- I'm trying something new
- trying to establish a new habit
- I'm low on energy
- its an intensely social situation.

More precisely, perhaps, I tend to do both. I flip-flop. I will give up quite easily. But then I will come back and try again. Usually after a short break and a lot of inner chatter. I keep trying, over the long-term. But the psychological flavour, the story, in the short-term is one of complete failure. The cycle is less like the tide coming in and going out gently, more like waves repeatedly crashing against rocks and wearing them down.
