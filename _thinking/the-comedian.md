Following on from [the Inner Critic](/thinking/inner-critic/), [Grips for the Critic / Coach coin](/thinking/grips-for-the-critic-coach-coin/), and [The Constable](/thinking/the-constable/). In particular, from the [Talk amongst yourselves](/thinking/the-constable/#talk-amongst-yourselves) sections: how do these parts interact with each other.

The Comedian does a humorous reframing of things. They make almost everything into a joke. This can lighten things up, make more difficult things easier to deal with. Ideally, that would be a gentle "don't be silly", but sometimes The Inner Critic's tone of voice sneaks in.

A useful aspect of The Comedian is the comedic (re)frame. Looking at the current frame, often blame or shame, and changing it. It's one flavour of how [the three uhds](/thinking/the-three-uhds/) can come out.

**The Comedian can be a particularly good antidote to The Inner Critic. They can highlight the ridiculousness of The Inner Critic's demands, standards, expectations.**

Something I've noticed: I tend to be quite creative when I'm trying to be funny.

## Lols elsewhere

A turn of phrase from [Pema Chodron's "Start Where You Are"](/notes/zen/pema%20chodron%20-%20start%20where%20you%20are.jpg) seems appropriate:

> Confront yourself with honesty and a sense of humour.

And one from [the Cynics](/notes/stoics-and-cynics/the cynic philosophers.jpg): 

> Combine wit and seriousness for an effective educational tool.
