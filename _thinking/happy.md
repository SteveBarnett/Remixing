Happiness. In particular: happy for no reason; happy in all circumstances; unlinking happiness and comfort.

Sufficient conditions for happiness are already here.

## Older notes

- Aversion includes hatred, ill-will or anger, as well as less intense emotions based on aggression. This energy keeps us trapped in thinking we’d be happy if only this moment would change. ... But joy is not a limited commodity, there’s plenty of it to go around. Joy is even available in our most challenging moments, if only we could see clearly.
- The seeking for happiness (somewhere else) is what makes us unhappy.
- A good life is rich and interesting, but not always happy.
- Recognise that happiness and suffering do, and can only, co-exist.
- Don’t cling to your own comfort. Then problems become no problem.
- (Be brave and insightful and) Let go of your ideas of happiness.
- Interacting with strangers and having healthy habits can make us happy.
- We tend to assume that we can only be happy if things go the way we want.
- Be "happy for no reason."
- We make specific requirements for our happiness. If the conditions aren't met, we can't be happy.
- We can be happy now.
- We don't have to wait until (the imaginary and impossible future when) we've solved all our problems.
- Make changes to be happy, not because we're inadequate.
- Even when you do everything right, perfectionism leaves you unhappy and dissatisfied with your achievements.
- Happy, fulfilled, people don't act out.
- This is a happy moment.
- Once we realize that we already have more than enough conditions to be happy, we can be happy right here and right now.
- We can be happy alongside being sad, we don't have to wait for the end of all our suffering
- We can allow ourselves to be happy now, before the end of our suffering
- We seek happiness because we have fixed on the idea that we are not happy now
- You can't become happy, you can only be happy
- Suffering and happiness are not separate. Where there is no suffering, there can be no happiness, and vice versa.
- Don’t hold your happiness hostage, contingent on unmet demands.
- Recognise that happiness and suffering do, and can only, co-exist.
- Become more other-centred, more other-loving. Remember that everyone has more suffering and less happiness than they want.
- Let go of the belief that “this isn’t it.”
- Research shows that practicing traditional loving-kindness meditation increases self-compassion and that practicing self-compassion increases joy and happiness.
- Happiness is possible immediately - even if it not everything is perfect.
- We owe true happiness to the useless and purposeless, to what is intentionally convoluted, what is unproductive, indirect, exuberant, superfluous, to beautiful forms and gestures that have no use and serve no purpose.
- When we believe happiness should take a particular form, we fail to see the opportunities for joy that are right in front of us.
- Attaching our happiness to a specific outcome causes us all sorts of suffering. To manage that distress, we attempt to control everything that is happening around us.
- Happiness doesn't depend on external conditions alone; it depends on our way of looking at and seeing things.
- In Buddhism, the means and the ends should be identical. There is no path leading to happiness; the path is happiness itself.
- There are seeds of happiness and joy in us and when they are watered they give rise to the energy of joy and happiness. The contemplation here is to recognize these seeds.
- Your search for happiness is what makes you feel miserable.
- Happiness can't be acquired, only revealed.
- Comfort is already here and now.
- Instead of trying to avoid the discomfort, open yourself completely to it
- Chasing comfort makes us avoid pain: we never see what's on the other side
- Explore just a bit beyond your comfort zone.
- When we use a soft front and strong back to stay with the discomfort of difficult emotions, they tend to arise, do their little dance, then move on.
- stop and recuperate, despite the discomfort of knowing that the work remains unfinished.
- We're addicted to running away from discomfort.
- Turn towards feelings, especially uncomfortable ones.
- Calm, comfort, pleasure is not the point of practice. It’s contact with yourself as you are.
- If you notice any tightness or discomfort, invite yourself to settle, to be soft, to relax, to settle.
- Dodging triggers may seem to create a feeling of comfort and safety, but therapists know that behavioural avoidance most often leads to a worsening of symptoms, not a healing of them.
- This discomfort, this sense of being triggered because things are not “right,” because we want them to last longer or to go away, is the felt experience, the visceral experience of the fundamental ambiguity of being human.
- The uncomfortable territory of "life not on my terms"
- Dukkha is the existential angst we add to our experiences of pain, discomfort, unease, longing.
- When you feel discomfort with something, including your zazen, expand your awareness and notice how the feeling is part of a larger whole, is less central than it seems.
- We can radically change our relationship to whatever causes us discomfort, such that the discomfort can be recognized and endured without it overwhelming or destroying us.
- Learn to let go and relax into the moment. Your interest in being right, safe, under control begins to fall away.
