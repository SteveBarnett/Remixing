## Notes from [Life in Transition](https://stoicismforhumans.substack.com/p/life-in-transitione)

Stoic advice for changes in your life.

Life transitions can be pleasant or unpleasant, predictable or unpredictable, long-awaited or sudden and startling. But they all have one thing in common: transitions can be times of great uncertainty, anxiety, or simply weighty reflection. 

### Be prepared for anything

>  I do not know what will happen, but I do know what can happen. I exempt none of that from expectation: I expect it all; and if I am spared any of it, I count myself fortunate. ... I expect the best, but prepare for the worst.<br>- 

Seneca, Letters on Ethics

### Welcome change

> Is one afraid of change? Why, what can come about without change? And what is nearer and dearer to universal nature?<br>- Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

Humans are parts of the universe, and everything in the universe experiences constant change. Therefore humans experience constant change. The logic is devastatingly simple and yet can be so hard to accept.

These occurrences and transitions are neither good nor bad in themselves; they simply are. It’s what we do with them that counts. 

### Make the best of things

> how you act is of moral significant, and that the material on which you act is neither good nor bad in itself<br>- Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

Transition periods provide raw material for us to show what kind of people we really are. Transitions can be times when we grow in unexpected ways, when we find new resources within ourselves. Epictetus says that for every challenge we face, we should look within and see what virtue we have to deal with the problem: perspective, endurance, strength, self-control, or others.

We can see that this is true because often we look back at our lives and think about what has shaped us, it’s those transitional times that stand out the most. ... As unwelcome as some of these transitions may be, we can still find ways to make the best of them.

It's easy to be logical and objective when someone else has a problem, but when the problem strikes us we find it difficult to be so clear-eyed. ... Our task [is to] ... rise to the occasion of being a good person during a difficult time.

### Concluding Thoughts

So we could sum up our discussion today in three bullets:

- Prepare yourself for a wide variety of transitions before they happen.
- Remember the universe is in constant transition, and therefore human life is in constant transition.
- Make the best of a difficult time by identifying what virtues you can bring to bear and how you can grow through this transition.

> All that you now see will be changed in no time at all by nature that governs the whole, and from its materials she will make new things, and from their material new things again, to keep the universe forever young.<br>- Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
