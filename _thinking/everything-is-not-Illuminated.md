- You are human, so the process of growth, maturation, is never done.
- No human can be always compassionate and insightful and generous.
- Making mistakes then learning, unlearning, and relearning is a good sign that you're on a good track.
- Gentle, honest, self-inquiry helps you soften up, lighten up, wake up.

## Quotes

perhaps the most pervasive delusion about personal growth, inner science, and spiritual practice: completion

Contemplative practice and inner science, even combined with excellent therapy, will not turn you into a saint.

There is no such thing as a perpetually compassionate human heart, an endlessly insightful human mind, and eternally generous human hands. Everything is not illuminated, and the process of emotional, relational, and spiritual maturation is never—not ever—complete. Anyone who thinks, suggests, or presents otherwise you should be very wary of.

Mistake-making, learning, unlearning, and relearning is a reliable way to know that inner science is sincere.

The tender process of honest self-inquiry is the gate to soften games of protection and start waking up to what we do.

Inner work doesn’t buy you a stairway to heaven and living human beings don’t vibrate to higher realms. Nothing embodied is or ever will be flawless, immaculate, or numinous. Our shaky imperfection thickens the plot as the path of self-knowledge and self-authorship spirals up and down, backward and forward, plummets, rises and falls.
