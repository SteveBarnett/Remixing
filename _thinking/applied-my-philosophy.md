I tend to be a very practical person. Although I love analysis and thinking and figuring things out, it usually comes down "and now what?" Below are practices that help me bring to mind elements of [my philosophy](/thinking/my-philosophy/).

- Notice the map, what if simplifies.
- Look more closely. Look for the edges.
- Watch things change. Look at the points of resistance.
- Notice your patterns, their causes and conditions. Notice the divisions, the opposites.
- Look for yourself, at zero distance. Rest, let go, notice what's right there.

## With their truths

- Reality is one indivisible whole. **Look for the edges.**
- Reality is flow, motion, process. **Watch things change.**
	- Resistance to the flow is what brings complexity, forms. **Look at the points of resistance.**
- Reality is complex, deep, rich. **Look (ever) more closely.**
- Perception is participation. **Notice what you're adding, in particular the divisions, the opposites.**
- Concepts are a map, not the territory. **Notice the map, what if simplifies.**
- Our true nature is the context of consciousness, not the contents. **Look for yourself, at zero distance.**
- The self is causes, conditions, patterns. **Observe your patterns, their causes and conditions.**
- This truth is simple, close, immediate. **Rest, let go, notice what's right there.**
