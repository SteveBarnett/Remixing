Exploring some angles on rejecting the rigged game (of "not good enough" from [Perfectionism page](/thinking/perfectionism)).

Not giving up.

- Nope
    - Rejecting the terms of engagement
    - Not playing by the rules
    - "[I would prefer not to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartleby,_the_Scrivener)"
    - Refusing to play the rigged game
    - "How about no?"
    - Deface the currency (Cynics) - be indifferent to (bad) conventions and customs
    - Don't-know mind
    - Reality is [empty](/thinking/empty/)
    - Both/and instead of either/or
    - Unity instead of putting things in boxes
- Society
    - Question, maybe reject, the scripts for what counts as a good life
    - You don't have to ride the escalator you've been put on
    - What society presents as rules, treat as guidelines
    - Throw away society's rule book
    - Find escapes and tricks for avoiding the most problematic norms
- Values    
    - Using an inner compass instead of an outer map
    - Find your core set of values and don't compromise
- Looking for the root cause, not just treating the symptoms
