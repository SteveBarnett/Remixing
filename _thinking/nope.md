Exploring some angles on rejecting the rigged game (of "not good enough" from [Perfectionism page](/thinking/perfectionism)).

Not giving up.

- Nope
    - Rejecting the terms of engagement
    - Not playing by the rules
    - "[I would prefer not to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartleby,_the_Scrivener)"
    - Refusing to play the rigged game
    - "How about no?"
    - Deface the currency (Cynics) - be indifferent to (bad) conventions and customs
- Using an inner compass instead of an outer map
- Looking for the root cause, not just treating the symptoms
