Exploring some angles on rejecting the rigged game (of "not good enough" from [Perfectionism page](/thinking/perfectionism).

Not giving up.

- Rejecting the terms of engagement
- Not playing by the rules
- Using an inner compass instead of an outer map
- Flipping the table
- "[I would prefer not to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartleby,_the_Scrivener)"
- Refusing to play the rigged game
- Looking for the root cause, not just treating the symptoms
- Keep asking why rather than what or how
- "How about no?"
