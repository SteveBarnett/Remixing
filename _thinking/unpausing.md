This week my very old dog Roxy died. About a year and a half ago the vet used the phrase "palliative care" and something in me clicked (maybe snapped) and I turned almost my full attention to looking after this old doggo. 

I took that carer role very seriously. Because of how I tend to be, I took it probably a bit too seriously. I found it really heart-breaking, also because of what I'm like.

Now that she's gone, I'm able to reflect and see that it feels like I put a lot of things on pause for that year and a half. In particular, some creative pursuits and travel. Now I want to start slowly unpausing them.

It feels like I was

- Zoomed in. Other things were still there, they were just outside my field of vision. Or they were quite obscured, distant, fuzzy.
- The (battery) power to other things was being redirected to carer duty. But also it felt like there was overall less energy.
- Leaky. The stress and anxiety (lots of it self-induced, admittedly) of caring for an end-of-life dog leaked out into other areas. In particular, my sleep has been bad for most of that time, and terrible for a few months.

It felt a bit like a swarming, like crunch time. High energy, high intensity, but... it went on longer that than that level of output and intensity could handle. So the power ran down, into the reserves, and starting damaging the battery. Like [My burnout safeword is Potato](/thinking/potato/).

It was something like "all fast system, no slow system". Intense and exhausting.

When I want to do something like sketching, I found myself asking:

- Do I have battery for this?
- Do I want to spend battery on this (instead of Roxy)?
    - I was spending battery on legit care things
    - But also on stress
    - And I had less battery because of the stress and lack of sleep

It's like the battery health has diminished. Usually you replace and old battery, so maybe this is more like a worn-out muscle. Or like batteries that are usually replaced, recharged, reset, but these ones have been over-stretched, over-extended. Maybe it's also a bit like I had a lot of different small batteries, but it became on big battery.

I'm going to slowly, carefully, pick stuff up again.
