## Gathered notes

- Suffering is part of life.
    - Trying to avoid or escape just makes matters worse.
- When we really understand this, we are free to be exactly as we are.
- We can't know what Gotama really said or believed.

## Raw notes

**suffering is part of this aliveness, and that efforts to avoid suffering or escape from suffering are a denial of this aliveness.**

We are all just human here, including Gotama, assuming that such a person actually existed historically. But even if there was once such a man, **we cannot know what he really believed or really said**, despite the insistence by some Buddhists—mainly the Theravadins—that the suttas in the Pali Canon are accurate historical accounts. Obviously they are not. Those suttas, which are said to be accounts of talks given by Gotama to the monks of his era, were preserved orally for around 450 years—passed from one person to another in the form of stories—until finally, after much debate, they were put into written form during the Fourth Buddhist Council in the first century BCE.

So **the idea that those suttas are in any way an accurate accounting strains credulity**. But so great is the desire of humans to have an infallible authority on whom to rely, that millions of Buddhists take every word of those scriptures as literally true and factual.

**Suffering cannot be avoided. Trying to avoid or escape suffering just makes matters worse.**

If you have an interest in spirituality and spiritual teaching, it is crucial to understand this point. Most teaching represents a conveyance of tradition—not a phenomenology of direct experience.

As soon as one really comprehends the thorny truth that, **short of death, there is no exit from this aliveness and the relentless**, painful self-awareness that comes with it, freedom is apparent. **You are free to be you exactly as you are right now.**

one’s understanding of oneself and the world will never be final.
