## Practical Practice bits

Things that I'd like to keep front of mind

- Focus more on **avoiding bad outcomes** than on trying to achieve good outcomes
- Prefer **simpler, older, rules** and guidelines
- Do lots of **small experiments**

## Memory version

- Do simple, respect old
- Avoid bad, choose late
- Small risks, no SPOFs

## Short version

- Stick to simple rules
- Respect old habits and rules
- Avoid known bads instead of looking unknown goods
- Keep your options open
- Take lots of small risks
- Avoid SPOFs

## Long version

- Stick to simple rules
- Avoid Single Points of Failure
- Resist the urge to suppress randomness
- Have skin in the game
- Experiment and tinker: take lots of small risks
- Keep your options open
- Focus more on avoiding things that don't work than trying to find out what does
- Respect the old habits and rules that have been around a long time
