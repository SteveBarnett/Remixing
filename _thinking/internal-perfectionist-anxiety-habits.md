Bringing together and mashing up some IFS bits, Perfectionist bits, Performance Anxiety, and Tiny Habits / Atomic Habits / Switch.

Something I realised scribbling my [Overcoming Performance Anxiety](/thinking/performance-anxiety/) notes was how my thoughts still tended to veer towards Perfectionism. When this is combined with my tendency towards binary thinking, it can exacerbate into "The First Step Problem". I think that's the main thing I want to explore here.

## The First Step Problem

The "once the event starts you’ll settle in" line in particular resonated for me. I've felt that very viscerally many times when I've done a talk about work stuff. That first ten minutes is a heart-pumping adrenaline-fuelled thrill ride. But then I settle in and start to enjoy it.

"Surviving" The First Step seems pretty key.

### Good

As in: good behaviours, patterns, habits, valued action.

- It can be hard to take the first step for good behaviours.
- For good habits, I can get stuck at the first hurdle, the first step. "It's only worth doing if it's 100%." That feels intimidating, like a very large or impossible goal.
- However, after getting past the first step, I have a tendency to fall down an asymptote. Which is good!

Can feel like a lack of motivation, disinterest. Future-discounting problem too?

The blocker is getting started.

### Bad

As in: bad behaviours, patterns, habits, actions not aligned with my values.

- It can be easy to give up after one step of a bad behaviour or a bad outcome.
- For bad habits, when I stumble at the first hurdle, fail at the first step, I have a tendency to give up, and fall down an asymptote. "It's not 100%, so give up."
- However, there are lots of tips and tricks for avoiding that first step. It is possible to stop on the second or third step: it just tends to be much more difficult.

Can feel like fuck it, giving up. Or like a cheat or a treat.

The blocker is stopping once you've started.

- PACT goals
    - **Purposeful**. Meaningful to your long-term purpose in life.
    - Actionable. Based on outputs you can control, an adaptable approach.

### Good

- Pay extra attention to the first step.
- Do the thing to bring about the mood; don't wait for the mood to do the thing.
- Notice that your resistance is to the first step.
- Remember that every step afterwards is easy in comparison.

### Bad

- The first step to building tolerance for Life is physical and mental stillness. 
- Notice the next step as though it's the first step.
- Is it really more difficult to stop after the first step? Can I just begin again?
- Ride the wave, surf it.
