- Cessation is the source of the Absolute.
- After an awakening experience, we function better, we're triggered less often.
- Even the Buddha was cranky sometimes!

## 1. Kensho - Seeing one's true nature

1. Absence of self, no-self experience
2. Unity experience, love
3. Recognition of true identity

Temporary, multiple. Personality comes back, but often changed.

Realisation needs to penetrate our consciousness quite deeply for something dramatic to happen.

Typically each koan gives a little kesho.

## 2. Satori - foundation of consciousness shifts

- The truths we hold closest are what bind us most tightly to our sense of self, our personality.
- Passionate interest and action can still occur, but we're not crushed if things don't work out.

## Daigo-tettei - "final awakening"

- Very rarely happens.
- Not really final, but very significant.
- Core personality issues are resolved.
- The source of the troubles stops, but existing consequences still have to play out.
