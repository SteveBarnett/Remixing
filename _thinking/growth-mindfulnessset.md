I think that maybe Growth Mindset and No-self have some overlap, things in common. And I don't think I've read about this anywhere before.

Some qualities of a person with a Growth Mindset, and things that seem to correlate in/with Buddhism

- Believes ability can be developed (things can be improved)
    - The Third Noble Truth: there is an end to suffering
    - No-self: our abilities are not fixed, static
    - Wise
- Believes that success, mastery, comes from effort
    - The Fourth Noble Truth: the way to the end of suffering is the Eightfold Path
    - Wise
- Strong appetite for learning
    - Impermanence: things are constantly changing and changeable
- Embraces challenges, persists in the face of setbacks (setbacks are inevitable)
    - The First Noble Truth: there is suffering (or, human life feels unsatisfactory)
    - upekkha (equanimity)
- Enjoys feedback and constructive criticism
    - The Third Noble Truth: there is an end to suffering
    - metta (loving-kindness)
    - Wise
- Finds lessons and inspiration in the success of others
    - mudita (empathetic joy)
    - Generous
