I think that maybe Growth Mindset and No-self have some overlap, things in common. And I don't think I've read about this anywhere before.

Have a Growth Mindset. See that setbacks are a chance to learn, that success comes from effort not innate skill.

## Fixed mindset

Believes intelligence is static.
Praise for ability can push towards Fixed mindset.
Leads to a desire to look smart.
May plateau early and achieve less than their full potential.
Deterministic view of the world.

Needs constant reassurance.
Can't take criticism, or failure. Sees the results as a measure of their worth. Demands percfection, being the best.
Assigns blame, finds excuses.

### Tendencies

- Avoids challenges
- Gives up easily
- Sees effort as fruitless
- Ignores useful negative feedback
- Feels threatened by the success of others

## Growth mindset

Believes intelligence can be developed. (The Third Noble Truth, "there is an end to suffering", aka things can be improved. Also No-self. Patience,)
Leads to a desire to learn. (Impermanence. No-self. First of Fourfold task, "Embrace life")
Keeps reaching new levels of achievement.
Greater sense of free will.

Praise for effort can push toward Growth mindset.

Growth happens best when you're held to a high standard and have a nurturing atmosphere. (Self-compassion) Feedback promotes learning.

Focuses on continuous improvement, progress, learning new things. (The Third Noble Truth, "there is an end to suffering", aka things can be improved, also Impermanence. Patience)
Sees feedback or failure as a learning opportunity, a wake up call to bounce back. (First of Fourfold task, "Embrace life". upekkha (equanimity).)
Believes effort is what brings success. (The Four Noble Truth / the Eightfold Path. Patience)

### Tendencies

- Embraces challenges (the first noble truth?)
- Persists in the face of setbacks (the first Noble truth, upekkha (equanimity). Patience)
- Sees effort as the path to mastery (Precepts (as aspiration, not as prohibition). Patience)
- Learn from criticism (Right Effort. upekkha (equanimity))
- Finds lessons and inspiration in the success of others (metta (loving-kindness), mudita (empathetic joy), Generosity)
