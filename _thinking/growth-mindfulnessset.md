I think that maybe Growth Mindset and No-self have some overlap, things in common. And I don't think I've read about this anywhere before.

## Overlaps, intersections, and crossovers

The Three Marks of Existence

- Impermanence
- Suffering
- No-self

The Four Noble Truths

1. There is suffering
2. The origin of suffering is craving
3. There is an end to suffering
4. The way to the end of suffering is the Eightfold Path

The Four Heavenly Abodes / brahmavihārās

- metta (loving-kindness)
- karuna (compassion)
- mudita (empathetic joy)
- upekkha (equanimity)

The counters to the three poisons

- Generosity (counters Grasping)
- Lovingkindness (counters Aversion)
- Wisdom (counters Ignorance)

Growth Mindset

- A key part of having a Growth Mindset is the belief that intelligence and ability can be improved through effort. Things can get better, I can do something. This feels a bit like the Third Noble Truth: there is an end to suffering, there is a(n eightfold) path. It's also a bit like No-self: a person's qualities are not fixed and static.
- Another part is the a person with a Growth Mindset embraces challenges. They see they as unavoidable, and a good way to learn and improve. The angle that challenges, unsatisfactoriness, is inevitable feels like it aligns with the First Noble Truth.
- There's also the more broad idea that growth happens best when we're both held to high standards and are in a supportive environment. 
- A person with a Growth Mindset has a strong desire to keep learning. They're focused on continuous improvement and progress.
- A person with a Growth Mindset believes that effort is what brings success. This aligns with the Third Noble Truth.
- GM learns from from criticism, embraces feedback. Sees failure as a learning opportunity, a wake up call to bounce back. Upekkha (equanimity).
- Finds lessons and inspiration in the success of others. This is mudita (empathetic joy).
