The way I tend to remix things is through iterative highlighting and summarising from several sources.

- The summary is personal, temporal, contextual, interpretative. It's not intended to be an objective, true, accurate representation of the sources.
- The summary is intended to be signposts, reminders, a [map](/thinking/map/). It's not intended to be a complete, exhaustive, full representation of the sources.

A rework, remaster, remake, revamp. A transformation, transmutation, modification, adaptation.

## World salad 2025-05

- Mix again, re-record, re-combine
- Synthesise, integrate, mix, consolidate
- Transform, change, convert, alter
- Summarise? Remix, but opinionated. Sifting, selecting, refining, honing.
- Learning, **interpreting, interpolating, interconnecting**

From Everything Is A Remix:

## Process

For a topic that becomes a Special Interest.

- Take long form notes as I go
- Make a summary/highlight combo of the bits that stand out
- Take long form notes from several other sources
- Make summary/highlights of those
- Make an uber-summary/highlight from the other summary/highlights. Things that keep coming up across different takes on the same topic.

The final notes as necessarily lossy. But that's okay. The final notes are intended as signposts and reminders, not complete records.
