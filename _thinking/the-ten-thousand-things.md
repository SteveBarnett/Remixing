Notes from [The Ten Thousand Things by Saltzman, Robert](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34355989-the-ten-thousand-things).

## Gathered bits

- We have no choice in the matter
- **Awakening is an ongoing process**
- Personality doesn't go away
- You are not doing anything. Not deciding anything. Not choosing anything.
    - **Changes in ourselves happen as “doings” of the universe, not actions done by us**, a “decider”
    - We are not producing thoughts any more than we are beating our heart
- A simple recognition of the mysterious, ineffable, suchness of this moment
- The questions of others are more worth knowing about than their answers
- The indefinable, unrestrained flow of perceptions, feelings, and thoughts is not happen to us, it is us
- **We are a happening, a stream of consciousness** over which we have no control
- **Everything you see, feel, and think is you. Any splitting is only conceptual, without factual existence.**
    - A decider or chooser would require a separate who could observe and judge
- Not the freedom to “choose,” but the freedom to be.
- Modern neuroscience and fMRI studies have shown that (for example) movement happens before the feeling or thought of choosing
    - **The sensation of choosing is more like a post-fact recognition**
- Much of the healing power resides not in the specifics of technique, but in the relief of being seen, heard, and understood
- Our minds seem to flow like water all over the place. **Nothing will keep it contained**. (SB: I like this. A good illustration of boundarylessness.)
- **Stop seeking; simply remain open, without reservations**
    - Come to a sense of being that is free of beliefs, paths, destinations, and “final answers”
- **When thoughts change, intentions change and behaviour changes. But one cannot choose what to intend, nor decide what to think.**
- **There is not a “you,” to whom things happen. What happens is you. Your reaction is not something a “you” does. Your reaction is you.** It’s all you.
- When someone you do something someone says is “not like you” – what could be more like yourself than something you just did?
- **Freedom means open-hearted participation in experience as it arises in real time without wishing for anything to be different.**
    - the liberty to be at ease with oneself
- **There is no security in being human.**
- **Every person has as much right to be here as any other naturally occurring phenomenon: a tree, a donkey, or the Pacific Ocean**
- **Thoughts, thinking, and thinker are mutually co-dependent**
    - **They cannot be separated except linguistically**
    - **one choiceless, nameless flow**
    - **different perspectives on the process of life**
- We are identical to the totality of experience
- Nothing special. Just life being lived.
- Awakening is about relaxation and acceptance of each moment, moment-by-moment, not striving and exertion in search of some later, “better” state of mind.

### Chapter 1, Awakening And Behaviour

- I cannot do that assembling any more than I can digest food or circulate blood. I have no choice in the matter.
- I am well aware that what I see and feel is a concoction of some sort or another, but this world is the world I have, and so I, an apparent constituent of this world of mine, live in it and with it—not in a world of conjecture, supposition, and mysticism about ultimate matters, but here and now.
- Awakening, I say, never ends, and neither does personality.
- Personality comes upon us like fate, and is expressed and lived out naturally. In my understanding, the only modifications to this automatic expression arrive via outside influences. Changes happen along with the “doings” of the entire universe, not in obedience to the wishes of an apparent “decider.”
- that “not-knowing” is part and parcel of what I consider “awake.”
- Each moment is unique in its suchness—its essential character—come and gone like a lightning flash.

### Chapter 2, A Clean Slate

- a simple recognition of the mysterious, ineffable suchness of this moment. In that recognition, there is no thought of meditation, no practice of meditation, and no meditator or doer of anything else.
- All at once you see that you are not doing anything. Not deciding anything. Not choosing anything.
- That fantasy fades, leaving no exit from the inevitable, ceaseless stream of consciousness
- Your beliefs are your beliefs merely because you believe them, which indicates nothing about their facticity.
- For a mind free of beliefs, what is, is, regardless of interpretations others may try to impose upon this aliveness
- This does not mean avoiding hearing what the Buddha had to say, or Trungpa, whom I just mentioned, or others. But it is their questions that are worth knowing about, not their answers.

### Chapter 3, Awakening Never Ends

- The “I” who is replying to questions here is not a “person” at all, which is really only a legal and social designation, but an indefinable, unrestrained flow of perceptions, feelings, and thoughts. That flow is not happening to me. That flow is me. In the eyes of the world Robert may be a person, but to myself I am not a person, but a happening, a stream of consciousness over which I have no control.
- The perceived myself of this moment cannot and will not last into the next. As a social construction, yes; as a memory, perhaps; but as a genuine happening, no.

### Chapter 4, Thoughts Don’t Hang Me Up

- This is a question of seeing and understanding the falsity of the habitual, repetitive idea that one can decide to change and then effect that change through “will power.”
- a fiction, and so is the idea of a separate, detached myself who can observe, judge, and finally choose which motivations to follow and which to ignore. Everything you see, feel, and think is you. Any splitting is only conceptual, without factual existence.
- The only “reality” you can ever know is the totality of what you see, feel, and think right now—all of it.
- No one is making that. No one is doing that. It’s all of a piece and cannot be split.

### Chapter 5, Freedom From Unwanted Thoughts

- When the path peters out, and you find yourself alone and without assurances of anything, this aliveness, unmitigated, is apparent.
- I mean alone in the comprehension that your indefinable presence in this mysterious stream of energy we call “life” brings your world into being—not the world, but your world.
- As I am not producing thoughts any more than I am beating my heart, I do not control them either.
- You cannot escape from this moment. Where would you go? You must live with whatever you see, feel, and think.
thoughts have no staying power. A thought arises and passes away again naturally, just to be replaced by the next thought.

### Chapter 6, The Freedom To Be

- Since the advent of functional magnetic resonance imaging and other recent ways of studying the brain, it has become apparent that when one “chooses” to move a part of the body, the necessary preparations for executing that movement took place in the brain before—sometimes seconds before— there was a feeling or thought of choosing anything. So the sensation of choosing is really more like a recognition, after the fact, of unconscious occurrences than an actual choice.
- The deepest wellsprings of thought and action exist beyond our ken and beyond conscious control.
- not the freedom to “choose,” but the freedom to be.

### Chapter 7, I’m A Different Person Now

- saying that myself is always changing does not mean that myself is nonexistent,
- If locked into a point of view that sees oneself as the thinker of thoughts, it will never even occur to that myself that “myself” is also a thought,
- What you call your “grappling” with the idea of constant change is a kind of resistance to the fact of impermanence.
- the proper treatment for PTSD is not avoidance of triggers. Emotional avoidance is a symptom of PTSD, not a treatment for it. Dodging triggers may seem to create a feeling of comfort and safety, but therapists know that behavioural avoidance most often leads to a worsening of symptoms, not a healing of them.
- Much of the healing power, I have found, resides not in the specifics of technique, but in the relief of being seen, heard, and understood.

### Chapter 8, What Makes Us Unique?

- It is not “my” mind. I don’t own it. I cannot control it. It will not mind me. It seems to flow like water all over the place. Nothing will keep it contained.
- “myself in here and the world out there.” Hanging on to that schema could feel a good deal more secure than going exploring without a map.

### Chapter 9, A Dog With A Bone

- If you speak the language represented by those squiggles, a flow of images and ideas arises effortlessly.
- You don’t have to try to decipher the squiggles, or try to construct images and ideas from them; it just happens.
- The observer is the observed.
- Reality is all of a piece, so there is no question of accepting one part of it while rejecting another.
- You don’t have to do anything. Just remain open to situations, thoughts, and emotions, meeting each fresh moment without reservations. In that simplicity is the end of seeking.

### Chapter 11, The Hero’s Journey

- I do not honestly know what I am or where I am. The schematic diagrams are in shreds and tatters.
- There is no you who has thoughts—no homunculus sitting in the middle of your skull doing thinking. You are thoughts. You are feelings. You are perceptions. “You” are in no way separate from them, nor are you the owner of them. Without them, I say, “you” do not exist.
- Awake means appreciating the weather, whatever the atmospheric conditions.

### Chapter 12, Magical Thinking

coming to a sense of being that is free of beliefs, paths, destinations, and “final answers”

### Chapter 13, Killing The Buddha

- mutual co-dependence with everything else in the universe, and consequently has no more power to choose what to perceive, feel, or think, than a jellyfish has the power to swim against the tide.
- To be sure, when thoughts change, intentions change and behaviour changes. But one cannot choose what to intend, nor decide what to think.

### Chapter 14, There Is No “How” To Be Free

- freedom is a natural quality of mind that does not have to be earned or deserved, but only noticed and appreciated.
- Here and now, in this very moment, is where freedom exists, not in some imagined location farther along the imagined path.

### Chapter 15, Love And Fear—It’s All You

- There is not a “you,” to whom things happen. What happens is you. Your reaction is not something a “you” does. Your reaction is you. It’s all you.
- What does she mean “not like you?” What could be more like him than something he just did?
- Because we are so deeply conditioned socially, we fall readily into the illusion of a myself that is not a flow, but a fixed presence that persists over time,
- one is never fully in the know. That is the human condition.

### Chapter 16, No Security In Being Human

- you are not “of God” or “in God.” God—the idea—is in you.
- Freedom means open-hearted participation in experience as it arises in real time without wishing for anything to be different.
- There is no security in being human.

### Chapter 18, Awake Is Not A Super-Attainment

- the liberty to be at ease with oneself,
- one’s own perceptions, thoughts, and feelings which are neither “real” nor “unreal,” but simply exist.
- a thousand other earnest but limited forms of striving for what can be only temporary relief. Relief from what? Often just the annoying sense of imagined separation that gives rise to a nasty itching to achieve spiritually.

### Chapter 19, The Story I Tell Myself

- the story of searching for something extraordinary—something not this—contains an implicit negative judgment of one’s present “ordinary” condition, which, compared to the fantasized life filled with meaning and significance, must seem disappointing, boring, or worse.
- The entire concept of self-worth is nonsense. You have, I say, as much right to be here as any other naturally occurring phenomenon: a tree, a donkey, or the Pacific Ocean. You never asked to be here, and are under no obligation to justify your existence, or to find so-called “meaning” in living and breathing.

### Chapter 20, The Universe Begins Right Now

- “absorption without self-consciousness,” lasts only so long until self-consciousness returns. If that state were endless, there would be no one to speak of it.
- Thoughts, thinking, and thinker are mutually co-dependent.
- They cannot be separated except linguistically.

### Chapter 23, Choiceless Awareness

- It is the ground of your own being that is to be seen, not the ground of being of the Buddha or anyone else.
- As long as one clings to anything—teachings, teachers, religions, practices—whatever—there will be no freedom.
- Thoughts, the process of thinking, and “myself,” the thinker—comprise one choiceless, nameless flow.
- If you notice this flow—this stream of consciousness—you soon become aware that the thoughts you call “my thoughts” are neither yours, nor chosen, but simply arise on their own.

### Chapter 24, Being Quiet Internally

- If you read a book without examining its ideas skeptically as you read, then those ideas will become your new fixed ideas.
- No “myself” stands apart from events and phenomena as the “experiencer” of those occurrences. That myself is an illusion. One is not having experiences. One is identical to the totality of experience,

### Chapter 25, The Fantasy Of Permanence

whether a particular behaviour seems wholesome on a physical level or not, at root, it may still be aimed at repression of unwanted ideas.

### Chapter 26, Is Everyone In My Life Only An Illusion?

Thoughts and thinker are not two separate items, but two perspectives on the same process, which is the process of life.

### Chapter 27, Self-Pity

- We may have the illusion of choice, but not the actual power to choose.
- By awakening, I only mean noticing that no one is choosing anything.
- When the effort to escape from what is—from what actually exists, regardless of how one feels about it—comes to an end, and the fantasy of attaining something “better” ceases, one is awake. There is nothing hidden or esoteric about this.
- In each moment, what is can only be embraced as is, never made over to suit your desires.

### Chapter 28, You Didn’t Make It, But You Have To Eat It

- I may be accustomed to calling those thoughts and feelings “mine,” but are they? I don’t make them, nor do I choose them. They arise on their own, spontaneously coming to awareness whether I want them to or not.
- for many of us, as thoughts and feelings bubble up naturally and unbidden, a “me” quickly takes credit— or blames itself—for them, as if a self-directed, self-governing, autonomous myself somehow produced and controlled thoughts and feelings moment by moment, choosing and deciding what to think and feel, and what not to think or feel.
- This assumption of credit or culpability happens so quickly and so seamlessly that many of us never even notice it.

### Chapter 29, The Source Of Consciousness

nothing special. Just life being lived.

### Chapter 30, The Heart Sutra

“form is emptiness, emptiness is form” is not a truth to be learned and recited, but a didactic device aimed at loosening attachment to extreme conceptions of “reality” which are either naïvely materialistic (“the table I see exists exactly as I see it”) or dogmatically nihilistic (“nothing exists objectively at all; the material world is only an illusion”).

### Chapter 33, The Feeling Of I-ness

In trying to define “myself,” one suffers a complete and total lack of perspective—an absence, I mean, of any non-self vantage from which to regard the matter.

### Chapter 35, Why Do You Not Understand?

What if knower, knowing, and known are not three distinct items, but one and the same happening just called by different names depending upon point of view? What if knower, knowing, and known cannot be separated or distinguished from one another at all?

### Chapter 36, A Wild Fox Spirit

who is running the show here? If “myself” feels a desire it never actually decided to feel or chose to feel, but only noticed when the desire, whatever its ultimate source, bubbled naturally to the surface, how can that be called choosing?

### Chapter 38, Psychotherapy And Self-Realization

Charlotte Beck, a rare kind of teacher who would brook no airy-fairy otherworldliness.

### Chapter 39, Understanding Nothing

- When I say “freedom,” I do not mean happiness. Nor do I mean immunity from ordinary human suffering. I mean the equanimity and peace of mind that emerge in the light of the comprehension that in this moment things are as they are and cannot be any different, including what I think, what I feel, and how I see and understand myself and the world.
- Awakening is about relaxation and acceptance of each moment, moment-by-moment, not striving and exertion in search of some later, “better” state of mind.
