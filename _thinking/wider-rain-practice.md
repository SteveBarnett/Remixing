I'm a big fan of [Tara Brach's RAIN meditation](https://www.tarabrach.com/category/rain/) (Recognize, Allow, Investigate, Nurture) and it's companion "[After the RAIN](https://www.tarabrach.com/after-the-rain-i/)".

I've been thinking about extending these forward / earlier slightly, continuing with the rain metaphor.


## Before the RAIN

- Notice the early warning signs, the triggers, that something RAIN-worthy is incoming.
- Warm up the mindfulness muscles.
- Plan to do a RAIN after the event.

## RAINdrop

Sometimes something RAIN-worthy comes up while you're in the thick of it. There's not enough time or space to RAIN there and then. It's usually possible to do just a RAINdrop, though, a tiny RAIN.

- **Recognise.** 
	- Notice what's arising.
	- Name the emotions and feeling tones.
- **Allow.**
	- Give everything a warm welcome.
	- Be patient, wait a little longer.
- Plan when to come back and do a longer RAIN.

## RAIN

- **Recognize.**
	- Notice what's arising.
	- Name the emotions and feeling tones.
- **Allow.**
	- Give everything a warm welcome.
	- Be patient, wait a little longer.
- **Investigate.**
	- The embodied sense of it.
	- The story you're adding to the feeling tone and the raw sense data.
- **Nurture.**
	- Find a sense of what would be comforting right now.

When you have trouble with the N of RAIN, go back to the I. Look more closely for what and where it's hurting.

## Heavy RAIN

- **Recognize.**
- **Allow.**
- **Investigate.**
	- What are trying to protect yourself from?
	- What are you unwilling to feel?
	- What are you numbing or distracting yourself from?
	- If you dropped the story you're adding, what would you be doing instead?
- **Nurture.**

## After the RAIN

After a RAIN meditation, stay in the open, awake, awareness for a while.
