I'm a big fan of [Tara Brach's RAIN meditation](https://www.tarabrach.com/category/rain/) (Recognize, Allow, Investigate, Nurture) and it's companion "[After the RAIN](https://www.tarabrach.com/after-the-rain-i/)".

I've been thinking about extending these forward / earlier slightly, continuing with the rain metaphor.


## Before the RAIN

- Notice the early warning signs, the triggers, that something RAIN-worthy is incoming.
- Think about putting on a RAINcoat or grabbing an umbrella.
- Or, just know that it's coming and relax into it.

## RAINdrop

Sometimes something RAIN-worthy comes up while you're in the thick of it. There's not enough time or space to RAIN there and then. It's usually possible to do just a RAINdrop, though, a tiny RAIN.

- Recognise. Notice what's arising.
- Allow.
	- Accept what's happening, accept what's arising.
	- Open up.
	- Be patient.
- As soon as you can, come back and do a longer RAIN.

## RAIN

- Recognize. Notice what's arising.
- Allow. This is just how it is right now.
- Investigate. The embodied sense of it.
- Nurture. A sense of what would be comforting right now.

When you have trouble with the N of RAIN, go back to the I. Look more closely for what and where it's hurting.

## After the RAIN

After a RAIN meditation, stay in the open, awake, awareness for a while.
