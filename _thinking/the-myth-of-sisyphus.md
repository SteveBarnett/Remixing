Freedom from illusions.

- That the task can be completed
- (That suffering can ever permanently cease)
- That a life has to be meaningful to be worthy
- That there is meaning to life


## Highlights

From [The Myth Of Sisyphus - by Robert Saltzman](https://robertsaltzman.substack.com/p/the-myth-of-sisyphus-ea5?publication_id=1031398&post_id=161318220&isFreemail=true&r=13ali&triedRedirect=true)

Not freedom from the task, but freedom from illusion. Freedom from the search for final answers.

We roll the boulder--not because we’ve found the meaning of life, but because something in us resists the lie that life must be meaningful to be worth living.

to be without illusions is the only freedom I know: the refusal to pretend that one can get the boulder to the top of the hill and keep it there, the willingness to face what is without comforting lies or narratives of redemption.

Sisyphus, in the final analysis, is not a figure of despair. He is the patron saint of radical clarity. In accepting the terms of his life unconditionally, he becomes—paradoxically—free. He rolls the stone not because he’s deluded but because there is nothing else to do.
