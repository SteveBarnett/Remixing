Something I've been doing for a while is daily reflections. Every morning I spend about five minutes looking back on the previous day. I have a short list that's a mix of habits I'm tracking and values I want to pay more attention to. I note how I went with them, and sometimes set an intention for the day.

- At the end of the week, I look back at the dailies and write a little summary.
- At the end of the month, I look back at the weeklies and write a little summary.
- At the end of the year, I look back at the monthlies and write a little summary.

It's interesting to see how how things ebb and flow over the weeks, months, years. And it's interesting to see what comes in and out of the list of habits and values.
