This one landed a bit weirdly for me. Some of the ideas felt like I'd heard them before but they were being renamed or reframed here. And it felt like some ideas were dismissed absolutely rather than reconsidered or reapplied, with their other-side-of-the-coins opposites being touted as absolute goods. Perhaps I was in a funny mood reading it?

Main takeaway: work iteratively on short-term goals, prefer PACT to SMART

## From Kindle highlgihts

### INTRODUCTION Goodbye, Linear Life

- In the following four parts of the book, you will learn how to: Get started by committing to curiosity.
- Keep going by practicing mindful productivity. Stay flexible by collaborating with uncertainty. Dream bigger by growing with the world.
- turn challenges into triggers for self-discovery and doubt into a source of opportunity.

### PACT Commit to Curiosity

#### 1 Why Goal Setting Is Broken

- This common shift from boundless curiosity to narrow determination is at the heart of why the traditional approach to goals keeps on letting us down; it impedes our creativity and prevents us from seeing and seizing new opportunities.
- When the future is uncertain, the neat parameters of rigid goal-setting frameworks are of little help;
- There are (at least) three other glaring flaws of linear goals:
    - Linear goals stimulate fear.
    - Linear goals encourage toxic productivity.
        - We work long hours, we feel guilty for taking breaks, we cancel on friends to do more work.
        - This emphasis on speed over sustainable progress
    - Linear goals breed competition and isolation.
- modern life has created a giant public leaderboard that amplifies the artificial need to compete.
- our brain is uncomfortable in the in-betweens.
- we tend to fall back on one of three defense mechanisms,
    - Cynicism
    - Escapism
    - Perfectionism
- Response 1 is automatic and rooted in the anxiety of uncertainty. Response 2 is autonomous and based on a strong sense of agency.
- From fixed ladders to growth loops.
- When we shift to a “loop” mental model, the journey follows iterative cycles of experimentation, with each loop building on the last.
- From outcome to process.

#### 2 Escaping the Tyranny of Purpose

- There are myriads of cognitive scripts, but I see three broad categories surfacing as people consider their next steps: the Sequel, the Crowdpleaser, and the Epic.
- THE SEQUEL SCRIPT: WHEN WE FOLLOW OUR PAST
- THE CROWDPLEASER SCRIPT: WHEN WE FOLLOW THE CROWD
- THE EPIC SCRIPT: WHEN WE FOLLOW OUR PASSION
- Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck and colleagues found that mantras like “find your passion” increase the likelihood that people will give up on their newfound interest when they run into inevitable hurdles.
-  Are you following your past or discovering your path? Are you following the crowd or discovering your tribe? Are you following your passion or discovering your curiosity?
-  Insights: Your moments of curiosity, random thoughts, new ideas, and questions that spark your interest. Energy: Your shifts in energy levels throughout the day, as well as what gives you energy or drains your energy. Mood: Your emotions during or after an experience, whether it’s a meeting, a workout, a podcast, etc. Encounters: Your social interactions or new connections and any insights or feelings that arose from them.

#### 3 A Pact to Turn Doubts into Experiments

- Purposeful
- Actionable
- Continuous
    - simple and repeatable
- Trackable
    - Notice I don’t say measurable here.
    - track your pact with a binary question: Have you done it or not? Yes or no? This makes your progress easy to monitor
- William James explained: “Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not.”
- Repeated trials are an essential feature of experiments. You need enough trials to obtain results you can trust.
- A pact is not a habit. A habit has an unbounded time commitment (e.g., exercise every day) driven by the desire to achieve a specific result (e.g., a positive health outcome).
- A pact is not a performance metric.
- A pact is not a resource-intensive project.
- Tasshin Fogleman makes the distinction between cold curiosity, which is functional and calculating, and burning curiosity, which is feverish and irrational. Your pact should sit in the in-between: warm curiosity, the kind that both pragmatically aligns with your existing interests and fiercely drives you to explore new ones.

### ACT Practice Mindful Productivity

#### 4 A Deeper Sense of Time

- In our culture, being a productive member of society is seen as a moral imperative.
- Within that quantitative frame, productivity is seen as a virtue and curiosity as a distraction.
- Experiencing a major personal change, such as a geographic move, becoming a parent, losing a parent. These are the quintessential liminal moments that might prompt an impetuous desire for control.
- today, gone tomorrow. But those neat boxes are not at all representative of how we experience time. The weeks of our life do not have the same weight.
- Research into time perception supports that many factors can impact how we process
- magic windows: those periods of creative flow that often occur when we are immersed in activities that capture our full attention,
- Managing your physical resources ultimately boils down to discarding the unrealistic expectation of always being “at your best.”
- our efforts to get more done actually slow us down.
- use sequential focus to choose one priority at a time and devote all your energy to it.
- parasympathetic nervous system,
- Moving your body has been found to relieve anxiety straightaway and to create a virtuous cycle that reduces anxiety over the long term.
- mindful productivity aims to answer three questions: Managing your energy: When is my magic
window? Managing your executive function: What belongs in this window? Managing your emotions: How can I keep the window open?
- Being mindful means interrupting the autopilot mode
- There are two key factors in choosing a Kairos ritual. The first is practicality.
- The second, most importantly, is to select a ritual that resonates with you personally.

#### 5 Procrastination Is Not the Enemy

- procrastination is often portrayed as a battle between the present self and the future self, it should really be described as poor teamwork between our emotional and our rational selves.
- Digging deeper, When I treated resistance as evidence, it helped me to understand why
- shifting your internal monologue from self-blame to self-discovery.
- procrastination points to nuanced psychological roadblocks that need addressing.
- the many reasons why you may be procrastinating can be divided into just three categories: they can stem from your head, your heart, or your hand.
- human motivation arises from the interplay of rational (head), affectional (heart), and practical (hand) factors.
- Head: “Is the task appropriate?” Heart: “Is the task exciting?” Hand: “Is the task doable?”
- The stronger the feelings, the more tempting it can be to shut them down—and the more important it is to lean into those feelings with curiosity instead of self-blame.

#### 6 The Power of Intentional Imperfection

- remarkable success not by striving for unattainable perfection but by embracing the perpetual juggle of life, where we must stay in movement—never quite achieving balance but constantly directing our attention to what is most important in the here and now.
- According to Vanini, a world without the potential for evolution would lack true perfection; it would be dead and static
- intentional imperfection means being deliberate about where you invest your efforts, striving for sustainable excellence rather than fleeting perfection.
- adjust those three ambition dials: Identify perfectionist patterns.
- Challenge your unrealistic targets.
- Choose progress over perfection.

### REACT Collaborate with Uncertainty

#### 7 Creating Growth Loops

- In many cultures, the wheel is a symbol of growth and success. It combines the idea of progress and wholeness: It is complete, and yet it keeps on moving.
- iterative cycles of trial and error.
- While introspection is simply noticing your thoughts and emotions, metacognition involves both awareness and analysis.
- metacognition is curiosity directed at your inner world—your thoughts, your emotions, your beliefs.
- into your everyday life. The tool is called Plus Minus Next,
- Not everything needs to be fixed; not every problem needs a solution. This is especially the case for one-off challenges. Acknowledging them is enough to move on.
- there is so much to learn from our mistakes; we should learn to fall in love with them.

#### 8 The Secret to Better Decisions

- there are three viable alternative routes for this transition: Persist; Pause; Pivot.
- to equate stasis with failure is a modern invention and a cultural myth.
- Refocusing on the hypothesis underlying your current experiment can be helpful.
- listed all the external and internal signals that might influence your decision,

#### 9 How to Dance with Disruption

- Accepting life’s disruptions doesn’t make you passive; it makes you agile.
- STEP ONE: PROCESSING THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE
    - a technique psychologists call affective
    - labeling our emotions results in higher brain activity in our prefrontal cortex,
- STEP TWO: MANAGING THE OBJECTIVE CONSEQUENCES
    - You may choose to do nothing if the repercussions are minor or the issue will go away on its own.
- de-escalate the consequences of any setback so you can move forward rather than give up.

### IMPACT Grow with the World
