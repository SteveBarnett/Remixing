## Three Tenets of a Zen Peacemaker

Taking refuge in The Three Treasures, I vow to live a life of:

- Not-Knowing, by giving up fixed ideas about ourselves and the universe.
- Bearing Witness to the joy and suffering of the world.
- Taking Action that arises from Not-Knowing and Bearing Witness.

## Ten Precepts of a Zen Peacemaker

Embodying The Three Tenets, I practice these Precepts:

1. Recognizing that I am not separate from all that is. This is the precept of Non-Killing.
2. Being satisfied with what I have. This is the precept of Non-Stealing.
3. Meeting the diversity of life with respect and dignity. This is the precept of Chaste Conduct.
4. Listening and speaking from the heart. This is the precept of Non-Lying.
5. Cultivating a mind that sees clearly. This is the precept of Not Being Ignorant.
6. Bearing witness to the offering of each moment. This is the precept of Not Talking About Others’ Errors And Faults.
7. Speaking what I perceive to be the truth. This is the precept of Not Elevating Myself And Blaming Others.
8. Using all the ingredients of my life. This is the precept of Not Being Stingy.
9. Bearing witness to emotions that arise. This is the precept of Not Holding On To Anger.
10. Honoring my life as a Peacemaker. This is the precept of Not Disparaging The Three Treasures.
