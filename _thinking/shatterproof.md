## Summary of summary

- Shatterproff: harnessing life's chaos to build better back, maybe including breaking along the way
- Contemporary life has complex challenges our stress system haven't evolved to handle
- Resilience is just about maintenance, not growth. We can run our resilience battery flat.
- Pain is a signal to pay attention. 
    - What’s the unmet need?
    - What are the causes and conditions that led to this response?
- Three universal human needs: confidence, choice, connection.
- Ask: how is my current behavior different from when I’m my best?
- Ask: what am I pretending not to know?

## Summary

- (Some overlap with antifragile (and kintsugi))
- Harness life's chaos, break if you must, then build back better
- humans’ three hardwired stress responses—bad things bias, the cortisol conundrum, and the anarchy of uncertainty—simply haven’t evolved to handle the complex challenges of contemporary life.
- Resilience helps us maintain or regain our baseline strength and well-being, but not become better or stronger (is this definitional?).
- We can't always control our levels of resistance.
- We can overwork our resilience muscle.
- Becoming shatterproof: harnessing our broken parts to access the best version of ourselves.
    - Change is pain repurposed.
- Pain is a signal to pay attention.
- How does my history explain my responses? (Causes and conditions)
    - What's the unmet need?
- Three universal human needs
    - confidence, brings feelings of worthiness, pride, learning, growth, and self-acceptance.
    - choice, free to function without pressure or threat, acting with agency and integrity, and staying true to ourselves.
    - connection, the sense that we belong, get along with others, and experience mutual closeness and support.
- Spot your shadows: the automatic responses and behaviours we tend towards when our needs are thwarted.
    - How is my current behavior different from when I’m my best?
- What am I pretending not to know?
- Confidence: find new ways to add value that don’t depend on naysayers’ opinions.
- Choice: delegitimise the oppressor. Use humour to get the courage to act.
- Connection: turn conflict into connection. Connection is belonging plus depth.
- "conditional regard" when others only show affection or approval when we behave the way they want

Notes from [Shatterproof: How to Thrive in a World of Constant Chaos (And Why Resilience Isn’t Enough) by Eurich, Tasha](https://www.shatterproof-book.com/)

## INTRODUCTION One Setback Away from Breaking

- for decades, we’ve been taught that no matter what life throws at us, if we can just manage to tough it out, we’ll emerge stronger on the other side.
- tried-and-true coping behaviors weren’t getting to the root cause of her suffering. Instead, they were masking the symptoms,
- we’ve long been taught that by strengthening our resilience muscles, we not only can survive anything, but grow stronger in the process.
- In this book, I will argue two things. First, because resilience is a limited resource, it alone may no longer be a complete coping strategy in this increasingly chaotic world. And second, the best response to constant chaos is not merely to survive it, but to harness it in order to become the best version of ourselves.
- becoming shatterproof doesn’t mean never breaking; it means continually choosing to build back better than ever.

## PART ONE The Surprising Science of Twenty-First-Century Thriving

### CHAPTER 1 Welcome to the Chaos Era

- While the threats humans face have evolved, our survival systems have not.
- Design Flaw 1: Bad Is Bigger Than Good
- Design Flaw 2: The Cortisol Conundrum
- Living in perpetual fight-or-flight mode isn’t just stressful, it drains the very resources we need to cope with stress.
- modern-day humans are almost constantly experiencing a heightened stress response, which is difficult (sometimes impossible) to switch off.
- Design Flaw 3: The Anarchy of Uncertainty
- humans’ three hardwired stress responses—bad things bias, the cortisol conundrum, and the anarchy of uncertainty—simply haven’t evolved to handle the complex challenges of contemporary life.

### CHAPTER 2 The Three Myths of Resilience

- applying several different practices was the most effective route to strengthening our resilience,
- What if, instead of waiting for things to rebalance, we could strengthen our capacity to adapt?
- THE THREE MYTHS OF RESILIENCE
    - Myth 1: Resilience helps us become better and stronger. Truth: Resilience helps us maintain or regain our baseline strength and well-being.
        - resilience practices—like letting go of negative emotions, changing one’s mindset, seeking social support,
    - Myth 2: Resilience is a choice. Truth: We can’t always control our level of resilience.
        - several factors outside our control make it difficult to stay resilient, especially under stress.
    - Myth 3: What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger. Truth: What doesn’t kill us makes being resilient even harder.
- what happens when we follow the “resilience-as-a-muscle” metaphor to its logical conclusion. When we continue working any muscle—adding more and more weight, doing more and more repetitions—it becomes fatigued, and without rest, it will fail completely.

### CHAPTER 3 Hitting Our Resilience Ceiling

- hitting our resilience ceiling. This is our breaking point, where our capacity to cope has become sodepleted that we snap at the slightest setback, demand, or annoyance.
- Research shows that we tend to overestimate our coping capacity; that is, we tend not to be self-aware about our resilience.
- Resilience is an exhaustible resource.

### CHAPTER 4 The Second Skill Set

- kintsugi,
- the best response to hard things isn’t merely to survive them; it’s to harness them.
- Becoming shatterproof, at a fundamental level, means harnessing the broken parts of ourselves to access the best version of ourselves.
- A shatterproof mindset, on the other hand, maintains that what doesn’t kill us will make us stronger if and only if we choose to harness it as a force for change.
- becoming shatterproof gives us access to our best selves—with tangible improvements in meaning, personal growth, inner peace, and even physical health.
- shatterproof practices are targeted to reduce frustration of, and better fulfill, specific unmet
psychological needs.
- while resilience drains mental resources, shatterproof practices replenish them.
- Mind Shift 1: From Discounting to Embracing Pain
    - becoming shatterproof is self-awareness walking.
- Mindshift 2: From Coping to Courage to Change
    - change is pain repurposed.
- Mind Shift 3: From Bouncing Back to Growing Forward
    - in an ever-changing world, those who reinvent themselves don’t just survive—they find new ways toprosper.

## PART TWO The Shatterproof Road Map

### CHAPTER 5 Step 1: Probe Your Pain

- Disconnection Driver 1: The Pain Paradox
    - where we feel more pain in the long term by avoiding it in the short term, the pain paradox.
- Disconnection Driver 2: Toxic Positivity
- Disconnection Driver 3: Freeze-or-Faint
    - What often eludes us is the option of taking a genuine interest in what our pain is trying to tell us.
- pain is a signal to pay attention.
- take charge of our personal narrative. Some questions to explore: How does my history explain my physical responses?
    - SB: causes and conditions?
- Practice positive social interactions, giving and getting support, self-compassion, singing, and listening to lullabies or folk music.
- Mood release: Complete the following sentences: “Right now I am thinking . . .” and “Right now I am feeling .
    - SB: RNIAO

### CHAPTER 6 Step 2: Trace Your Triggers

- While we can become “apathetic, alienated, and irresponsible,” they wrote, at our core, we are growth-oriented, “curious, vital, and self-motivated.”
- SDT identifies three universal needs that human beings are biologically programmed to seek, and which provide a direct path to fulfillment, motivation, growth, and self-actualization
- confidence, brings feelings of worthiness, pride, learning, growth, and self-acceptance.
- choice, free to function without pressure or threat, acting with agency and integrity, and staying true to
ourselves.
- connection, the sense that we belong, get along with others, and experience mutual closeness and support.
- confidence keeps us growing, choice keeps us authentic, and connection keeps us together.
- it’s crucial to move beyond merely managing our emotional reactions and learn to identify the unmet needs beneath them.
- In the context of becoming shatterproof, triggers aren’t simply things that upset us; they’re signals or reminders of unmet needs.

- Step 1: Identify Patterns
    - “not being taken seriously” (confidence), “being told what do to” (choice), or “being excluded”(connection). These are just a few of the most common triggers;
    - confidence triggers typically relate to our performance and contributions, choice triggers largely come from people, systems and random chance, and connection triggers usually stem from our interpersonal interactions.
    - for all intents and purposes, that was true because it was how Ross felt.
        - SB: no! Real, but not true?
- Step 2: Trace Triggers to Unmet Needs 
    - need audit, a tool to nail down our mst thwarted need
    - identify our fixations
    - our greatest unmet need creates our most intense fixation.
    - explore our biggest fears.
    - Our greatest need usually fosters our most visceral fear.
- Confidence: A sense that we’re doing well and getting better. ◦ Choice: A sense of agency and authenticity. ◦ Connection: A sense of belonging and mutual support.
- How to know you’re being tiggered: (1) Your thoughts and inner monologue turn negative. (2) Your
emotions and physical symptms worsen. (3) Your behavior becomes less well-controlled.

### CHAPTER 7 Step 3: Spot Your Shadows

- shadows—those automatic responses to persistently thwarted needs that drive us to behave, as Jung putit,like “the person no one wants to be.”, Shadow goals typically fulfill one of three compensatory motives (meaning, “If I can’t have conidence/choice/connection, at least I can have this”)- irst, we may focus on protecting ourselves as an antidote from the guilt, shame, and bruised ego
- Second, the motive of proving involves searching for any external evidence that—despite our fears to the contrary—we actually are worthy, powerful, and loved.
- The final compensatory motive, preventing, attempts to stop our momentary mood from worsening by escaping, ignoring, or downplaying issues.
- Shadow goals are overwhelmingly extrinsic in nature,
- I found one question to be particularly useful: How is my current behavior different from when I’m my best?
- I now knew what Carl Jung meant when he said that gaining awareness of our shadows helps us assimilate them into our self-concept without judgment, making the space for self-acceptance andreinvention.

### CHAPTER 8 Step 4: Pick Your Pivot

- sentinel events are unmistakable warnings that force us to confront the true toll of our shadows, prompting a shift in strategy to prevent anything similar from happening in the future
- make yourself better, make authentic choices, make things better for others. These closely mirrored the needs of confidence, choice, and connection.
       
## PART THREE Shatterproof Transformations and Tools
    
### CHAPTER 9 Crafting Confidence

- a fundamental level, confidence has two elements: a sense that we are doing well and a sense that we are getting better.
- Because perfectionists tend to fuse their self-worth with their achievements, even small setbacks set off a spiral of self-doubt.
- reflected best
- (Conveniently for perfectionists, research shows that regular confidence crafting is a powerful strategy to distract us from dwelling on our deficiencies.)
- What am I pretending not to know? 
- Finding confidence when others challenge it
    - Remember that we don’t need other people’s approval to craft confidence.
    - Find new ways to add value that don’t depend on naysayers’ opinions.

### CHAPTER 10 Crafting Choice

- suppression of our authentic selves (internal or external pressure to act against our true nature),
- coercion (external factors forcing us to obey, like micromanaging bosses or controlling parents),
- loss (losing something we value, like a relationship or promotion)
- disregard (being minimized or invalidated),
- unfairness (being the victim of inequity, like a colleague stealing credit), voicelessness (a lack of transparency or input).
- “delegitimizing the oppressor,” and I call bully jujitsu. 
    - SB: - jujitsu, it’s about using your opponent’s energy against them (no matter their size or strength) without causing undue harm.
- in the darkest of times, humor doesn’t just neutralize fear, it gives us the courage to act.
- The 2-2-2 tool permits us to pause for exactly forty-eight hours—no more, no less—while prioritizing what we need in the next two minutes, two hours, and two days
- the groups and roles we identify with offer particular safety because of the social support and shared purpose that come with them.

### CHAPTER 11 Crafting Connection
- At our core, humans are relational beings.
- Research reveals two basic building blocks of connection. The first is belonging.
- The second connection building block is relationship depth.
- conditional regard, happens when others only show affection or approval when we behave the way they want
- research shows that our single deepest connection (in Charlotte’s case, Zoe) has the biggest impact on our mental health and well-being, with additional attachments yielding diminishing returns
- OTHER WAYS TO CRAFT CONNECTIO
    - Turning Conflict into Connection
    - Something Greater Than Ourselves
- Building blocks of connection: (1) belonging (frequent, positive interactions), (2) relationship depth
(trust and intimacy-boosting interactions, reciprocal relationships).

## CONCLUSION Building a Shatterproof Life

Becoming shatterproof doesn’t mean never breaking—it means continually choosing to grow forward even in the face of devastating setbacks
