## Raw notes

### Introduction

- The life style of the Great Integrity, then, is not about withdrawal from civilisation, not about escaping into a life of meditation. It is about engagement with life. It is about **commitment to transcending our inhumanity.**

### The book

- In the infancy of the universe, there were no names. **Naming fragments the mysteries of life** into ten thousand things and their manifestations.
- Difficult and easy, long and short, high and low, define each other, **just as before and after follow each other.**
- Thus do we create what is to use what is not.
- Never seeking fulfilment, (we) are never unfulfilled.
- (The Paradoxes of Returning to the Great Integrity)
    - The first is to embrace simplicity and integrity.
    - The second is to consume only the needs of our body and soul.
    - The third is to **allow our love and concern for others to define our essentiality.**
- We are an inseparable part of what we are senselessly trying to coerce.
- **We are an intrinsic part of what we are foolishly trying to possess.**
- The highest virtue quietly serves universal needs. The lowest virtue actively strives for personal success.
- The highest morality serves common needs. The lowest morality is self-serving.
- The movement of the Great Integrity is infinite, yet its character is passive. Being defines every form of life, yet all originate in, and return to, non-being.
- When the ego interferes in the rhythm of process, there is so much doing! But nothing is done.
- **Act without acting on. Work without working at.**
- When are thousands of people attracted to a sage? When the sage positions themself below people, always listening, tirelessly responding to their needs.
- Since the sage treats everyone with love and respect, everyone loves and respects the sage.
- If you love, you will be fearlesss. **If you are moderate, you might always sense abundance in life.** If you live in humility, you will be widely trusted.
- The Way of the Great Integrity is like stringing a bow, pulling down the high, lifting up the low.
