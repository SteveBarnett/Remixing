I vow to **increase kindness in the world**. In myself, and in the people around me.

Particularly in the face of greed, anger, ignorance.

## What does that mean?

I'll do this by helping people:

- see and think more clearly;
- see the bigger, more inclusive, picture;
- on a spectrum not a binary.

Reminder note-to-self: I'm a people too.

## What will I do?

### Inwards

- Open up.
- Give everything a warm welcome.
- Be a mirror.

### Outwards

- See the paths of least resistance.
- Listen with lovingkindess.
- Yield, get underneath.
