Now lives at [MAP](/thinking/map/).

A first attempt at something like metaphysics (what is real?) and epistemology (what is true?).

- **Reality is one, complex, flow.**
- Our experience creates our reality, it doesn't describe Reality.
	- Perception is participation.
	- Concepts are a map, not the territory.
	- **Our true nature is the context of consciousness, not the contents.**

## Reality

> Reality is one, complex, flow.

- Reality is one indivisible whole.
	- It's nondual. There's distinction, but not division.
	- Every thing is deeply interdependent.
	- It's composed of wholes that are parts of other wholes.
- Reality is flow, motion, process. 
	- Life is movement.
	- Resistance to the flow is what brings complexity, forms.
- Reality is complex, deep, rich.
	- It's fractal. Looking more closely reveals new, more, detail.
	- There are no straight lines in nature.

## Experience

> Our experience creates our reality, it doesn't describe Reality.

<!-- Our perception, our concepts, create something that's many, simple, static. -->

### Perception

> Perception is participation.

- We don't have direct contact with reality.
	- It's filtered through our sense organs.
	- It's filtered through our (finite, human) mind.
- Perception and thought are nondual.
	- Their interaction, superimposition, creates dualities.
- We, our bodies, are not in nature, or separate from nature: we are nature.

### Concepts

> Concepts are a map, not the territory.

- All phenomena are empty, aggregates, exist only by convention.
- Layers, divisions, states, stages, are all creations of reality, not descriptions of Reality.
	- What we call things depends on the range of the observer.
	- In particular: opposites reveal, create, support, define each other.
	- In particular: the self is just an idea, a construction.
- Concepts are a grasp at reality.
	- Grasping creates dualities.
	- Grasping causes suffering.
- Concepts are many, simple, static. Reality is one, complex, flow.
- Reason and debate to end yours and others' suffering are a means to an end.
	- Even though they're empty too.

### Our true nature / No-self

> Our true nature is the context of consciousness, not the contents.

- The self is causes, conditions, patterns. It's a stream of dependently arising processes interacting to create the feeling of a separate self.
	- We maintain our sense of self by editing of, selecting from, experience. By resisting impermanence. 
	- The feeling of self is what it feels like to be thinking without realising you're thinking.
	- Anything that can be named or located can't be you: it's an object in awareness.
- Our true nature is "I am" before adding anything, before looking backwards or forwards, before classification, measuring, labelling, before concepts.
	- It's open, spacious, empty, luminous, formless, boundless.
- This truth is: simple, not complex; close, not far away; do less, not do more; on the surface, not deep; before thoughts, not beyond them; immediate, not prolonged.
