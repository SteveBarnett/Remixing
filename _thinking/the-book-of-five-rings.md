## Raw highlights

Musashi wrote The Book of Five Rings at the end of his life as a guidebook for the disciples he had taught face-to-face

Conflict is real. The Way is real. The student must use his or her real experience to resolve the two.

"You should investigate this thoroughly” is repeated more than any other phrase in the book.

Consider yourself lightly; consider the world deeply.
    
### THE WAY OF WALKING ALONE (or The Way of Self-Reliance)

Respect the gods and Buddhas, but do not depend on them.

Do not complain or feel bitterly about yourself or others.
    
Do not be intent on possessing valuables or a fief in old age.

Do not envy another’s good or evil.

Do not have preferences.

### The Earth Chapter
    
as representatives of Ways, Buddhism is a Way of salvation for man, Confucianism venerates a Way of culture, and medicine is a Way of curing various diseases. Moreover, poets teach the Way of Japanese verse; and then there are tea masters, archers and others who teach the various arts

the true Way of the Martial Arts is to train so that these skills are useful at any time, and to teach these skills so that they will be useful in all things.

By knowing the large, you know the small; and from the shallow, you reach the deep.

If you do not know others, it is difficult to understand yourself

One of the virtues of the bow is that the released arrow can be watched by the eye. The rifle bullet cannot be watched, and this is a weak point. You should investigate this matter thoroughly.

Going too far is the same as not going far enough

You cannot ignore rhythm in any of the arts and accomplishments.

You should discriminate thoroughly between the rhythm of success and the rhythm of failure.

Within the rhythms of large and small, slow and fast, know the rhythm of contact, the rhythm of spacing as well as the rhythm of resistance to rhythm

### The Water Chapter

your mind should not change in the least, but should be broad and straightforward, neither drawn too tight nor allowed to slacken even a little

There is observation and there is seeing.1 The eye of observation is strong. The eye of seeing is weak

Immobility means a dead hand; mobility means a living hand

Whether a stance is large or small, it should follow the circumstances and the advantage you wish to take

It is essential to think that anything at all is an opportunity to cut him down

Striking with this rhythm before your opponent has even considered pulling back his sword, avoiding a blow or striking with his sword is the “one count.” You should learn this well, practicing to strike quickly in the rhythm of the interval.

If you keep your mind on stabbing your opponent’s face, he will pull his face and body back. If you can make him do this, you will have various advantages for victory

In the midst of the fight, if you are intent on making your opponent flinch, you will have already obtained the victory

Parry your opponents’ rhythm, know where they will crumble, and you will have the victory

From time to time practice herding your opponents into a group and chasing after them

temper yourself with one thousand days of practice, and refine yourself with ten thousand days of training.

### The Fire Chapter

It is important that you be intent to use the advantages of the place, and so gain the victory with the place itself. You should investigate this thoroughly

gain the victory immediately by taking advantage of the moment his rhythm changes.

This is the heart of Pressing Down the Pillow. In “attack,” for example, suppress your opponent at the letter a; for “leap,” suppress him at the letter l; for “cut,” suppress him at the letter c. This is all done with the same understanding.

when your opponent is going to use some technique on you, it is important that you let him do it if it’s a useless one. But, if his action is functional, suppress it and keep him from completing it.
  
suppress what your opponent might think of doing even before the first letter of the word could be pronounced

defeat him the moment he strikes, preventing him from striking a second time

The heart of Stepping on the Sword, something used principally in the martial arts, is that even with bows and firearms, you must act quickly while they are being discharged

It does not mean attacking at the same time as your opponent. Stepping on the Sword is taking your action immediately upon your opponent’s action

all of them, according to the moment, are collapses from a discordance of rhythm.

It is essential that you grasp the sign of your opponent’s collapse and rush him with certainty so that he will be unable to recover.

It is important to quickly disregard whatever you are thinking and gain the victory by some method unthought of by your opponent.

Letting Go of Four Hands comes into play when both you and your opponent are of the same mind, you feel as though the fight has come to a stalemate, and you are making no progress.

when you cannot see through your opponents’ situation in any way, act as though you were going to attack vigorously, and you will see their intentions

There are many kinds of agitation. One is a feeling of danger, a second is a feeling that something is beyond your capability, and a third is a feeling of the unexpected

It is your primary consideration to not let him recover even a little

The heart of Mountains and Seas is that it is wrong to use the same tactic repeatedly during a fight between you and your opponent

### The Wind Chapter

In my martial art, we dislike such one-sidedness and narrowness of mind

it has been said since ancient times that the large goes together with the small. This is then not a matter of disliking the long unreasonably, but a matter of disliking the mind that prefers the long.

it is essential that both body and mind are composed in a straightforward way, and that you bend and warp your opponent, taking the victory by twisting and distorting your opponent’s mind

The heart of taking a stance is in waiting for the initiative

### The Emptiness Chapter
