## Recognise happiness

- We make specific requirements for our happiness. If the conditions aren’t met, we can’t be happy.
- **We overlook opportunities for happiness that are already here.**
- Don't let the content of awareness veil your true nature of happiness and peace.
- We tend to assume that we can only be happy if things go the way we want.
- Be "happy for no reason."
- Happiness can't be acquired, only revealed.
- You can't become happy, you can only be happy.
- Your search for happiness is what makes you feel miserable.
- **Let go of the belief that “this isn’t it.”**
- Once we realize that we already have more than enough conditions to be happy, we can be happy right here and right now.
- Don’t hold your happiness hostage, contingent on unmet demands.
- Happiness doesn't depend on external conditions alone; it depends on our way of looking at and seeing things.
- **Thing that makes us happy (that can seem counter-intuitive): social relationships; interacting with strangers; having healthy habits.**

## Accept unhappiness

- Recognise unhappiness, without trying to change it or fix it.
- Experience emotions fully, without separation or rejection, without adding anything.
- A good life is rich and interesting, but not always happy.
- Our need to have everything go our way is the cause of a lot of suffering.

## Problems

- We don’t need to be miserable while we work on our problems.
- The thought that life shouldn't be a struggle is painful, so we try to escape it.
- Everything, every thing, causes some problems.
- When you don't notice it, you identify with, you become, the unhappiness.
- **Sadness is part of the human experience.**

## Why can't it be both?

- We don’t believe we can have happiness and sadness at the same time. It seems like a paradox.
- We don’t have to wait until (the imaginary and impossible future when) we’ve solved all our problems.
- We're allowed to feel happy now, before the end of all our suffering.
- Suffering and happiness are not separate. Where there is no suffering, there can be no happiness, and vice versa.

## No problems

- Practice is not having a problem with having problems.
- Don’t cling to your own comfort and problems become no problem.
- In this moment, is there really a problem?
- What's there when there's no problem to solve?
- More important than what's happening is how you meet it.

## Keep going

- Let problems support your practice, enhance your ability to respond appropriately.
- We practice to (have the strength to) confront problems effectively.
- Slowly, painfully, reconcile to life.
- Do fewer (and fewer) things that make people (including you) miserable.
- Use whatever happens as opportunity to wake up, to soften.
- Letting go can take a lot of courage, but once you let go happiness come quickly.
- It needs great insight and courage to release our ideas of happiness. But, once we can do that, freedom and happiness can come very easily.
- Look for your unhappiness. Can you find it?
- Unhappiness can't last when you truly accept it.

## Other-centred

- **Reduce as much as you can your excessive self-concern.**
- Equalise our love of ourselves and others.
- **Everyone has more suffering and less happiness than they want.**
