- Inner attitude and outward ceremony can both be used to give meaning and value
- Rituals help gives us some community that we're missing today
    - We have lots of communication but not much community
- **We don't need to understand impermanence, we need to remember it**
- Ritual: **acting out our practice is symbolic, embodied, ways**

## Highlights

- There's a point to making some things stand out from the ordinary
- (Another thing that makes Western Buddhism boring: a suspicion of celebration or anything bombastic that borders on the puritanical.)
- Inner attitude isn't the only spiritually acceptable way to imbue something with meaning and value
- Everything that gave [the ceremony] such weight was symbolic, out of the ordinary, or non-verbal ... And, it was a collective experience.
- Meaning is a connection
- Today, we have tons of communication and just trace amounts of community. Rituals connect and situate people temporally.
- To me, Buddhist practice is not just about effectiveness. This is one reason I find the past decade's scientific hype around mindfulness rather dissatisfying.
- We don't need to understand impermanence, we already do. What we need is to remember it, and thatâ€™s mindfulness. A good way to do that is through something symbolic, non-discursive, active. A ritual.
- We should think more about ritual, about acting out our practice in symbolic ways that engage our bodies and senses
