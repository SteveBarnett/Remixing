## Notes to self

- Start with the agenda (content, not precise times).
- Have a good analogy. Maybe the camera lenses one. Or a classic ocean and waves or sky and clouds one.
- Could make little icon-like images to illustrate the points a bit: narrow / board; effort / effortless; object  / object-less.
- Make sure we have enough time for discussion too.
- Start disclaimer / note: we're presenting these as four distinct practices, but that's just for convenience. Really, they blur into each other. These four types are the map, not the territory. The territory is your experience of them.

## Practices

- **Focused Awareness**: very narrow, high effort, one object.
    - Cultivates concentration, tames a busy mind.
- **Flexible Awareness**: narrow, some effort, some objects.
    - Good for being flexible, but controlled.
- **Choiceless Awareness**: broad, variable effort, many objects.
- **Natural Awareness**: very broad, effortless, no object(s).
    - Highlights impermanence, fluidity.

With Natural Awareness, it's a bit like each of the attributes (width, effort, object) reaches a limit and flips to its opposite. Narrow becomes infinitely broad, effort becomes effortless, and object(s) become no-object. (Like a wave getting smaller and smaller until it disappears by becoming the sea.(?))

## Overview

- These four are a model / map for working with awareness, with the goal of helping to bring some fluidity and flexibility to your practice.
    - They're from The Little Book of Being: Practices and Guidance for Uncovering Your Natural Awareness by Diana Winston.
- They're different ways to meditate, but not hierarchical: they're useful for different things and situations.
- We'll very briefly discuss then do a short practice of four types of awareness: Focused, Flexible, Choiceless, Natural. They vary by:
    - width of attention, from narrow to broad;
    - amount of effort, from quite a lot to none;
    - the object of meditation, from one object to none (Could say: from one anchor to anchorless).

## Warm up

- Get into a comfortable position. Adjust your posture a little.
- Close your eyes, on have your gaze downwards and gentle.
- If you notice any tightness or discomfort, invite yourself to settle, to be soft, to relax.
- Take a few deep breaths.

## Cool down

- Take a few deep breaths.
- Notice how you feel now, after the practice.
- The same? A little different?

## Focused Awareness

- Most like "classic" mindfulness. Good for clarifying and unifying your mind.
- Choose one anchor for this session.
    - Whatever feels easiest or clearest. They all work equally well.
    - Breath, at your nose or chest or belly. Sensations in your hands, or feet. Or something else.
- **Warm up**
- Let your attention come to rest of your anchor.
- When you notice your attention has wandered, again, as it will, just gently guide your attention back to your anchor.
    - It can help to label the distraction, to help let it go from your mind.
- **Cool down**

## Investigative Awareness

- Attention a little broader, effort about the same, some objects but mostly one.
- Good for noticing the tone of moods, emotions, memories, and for noticing their impermanence.
- When something arises and pulls you away, let you attention rest on it briefly, then come back to your anchor.
    - Just noticing, witnessing. Not judging or evaluating.
    - Watch it shift, morph, change.
        - From "my emotion" to "an emotion passing through me."
- "Investigative" like explore it experientially, not like figure it out with thinking.
- **Warm up**
- Allow whatever happens, whatever arises.
    - It's okay to feel whatever you feel.
    - Whatever you're feeling, you're not the only one.
    - Naming the emotion can help.
- Bring attention to part of your body that feels at ease, solid, safe, stable, pleasant.
    - Feel the goodness for a moment. Let it sink in.
    - Use that as your anchor for this session.
- When an emotion arises, if it feels difficult, gently come back to your anchor.
- **Cool down**


## Choiceless Awareness

- Now we'll let our attention go more broad, have a more variable amount of effort, and take it more objects of meditation.
- We'll let go of our anchor and notice objects change and move through us.
- If your attention moves away from the anchor, there's no need to return to it.
- Treat it like a playful series of noticings.
    - Let go of like or don't like, and just notice things arise and pass away.
- Some things you might notice:
    - body sensations like heavy/light, warm/cool, tingling and vibration.
        - Let go of the story and just notice the changing sensations.
    - emotions like sadness, joy, irritation, anxiety, sometimes nothing much at all, sometimes there but subtle.
    - mental activity like remembering, planning, fantasising.
    - maybe something we don't usually focus on with meditation: smells or tastes.
- **Warm up**
- Start with your anchor.
- Notice what's arising. Body sensations, emotions, mental activity, something else.
    - A sound, a memory, a sensation in your body.
    - Things might move slowly or quickly.
- Can feel disorienting if you usually practice with an anchor.
    - That's okay. Notice that feeling for a moment.
    - If it helps, come back to your anchor for a moment.
- **Cool down**


## Natural Awareness

- **Warm up**
- 
- **Cool down**
