### Tao Te Ching - yielding, softness

- Tenderness, softness, yielding, suppleness, weakness, goes with life
- Reacting and responding, bending and bowing under pressure, means you’re alive
- Nothing’s worse than attacking what yields
- To attack what yields is to throw away the prize. The prize thrown away by the aggressor is compassion.
- The yielder, the mourner, keeps that prize. The game is loser take all.

### Yield word salad

- Prevail not by demolishing the opponent, but by transforming the relationship
- Use their energy against them by returning it, by moving along with the attack and subtly diverting it so that it cannot land effectively
- Using softness, connection, sensitivity and calmness to transform a situation

### Art of War.
