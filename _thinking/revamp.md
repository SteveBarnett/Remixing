## Gathered notes

- Open-minded, not-knowing, scepticism.
- An ethic of care (or non-uncaringness). A path of practice.
- We are not fixed entities – we are dynamic processes.
- Just process. Nothing solid. But not nothing either.
- Nirvana is a transitory mind state free of greed, hatred, and delusion. Life continues, but with added clarity and commitment.
- Embrace the whole of the human condition and work with it.
- Dukkha is the inescapable aspects of the human condition, whether we indulge in “craving” or not.
- Perfectionism seeks an exit from the human condition, not an exploration and enrichment of it.

## Raw notes

### Introduction

- "the flexible appropriation of tradition".
- at its core, secularity insists of the **cultural specificities of time and place**.
- Not a belief system, not a badge of identity or of ethnic belonging, but rather a meaningful way of life or path of practice ...
- typically Buddhist in its **open-minded scepticism**.
- Appamāda: care, non-carelessness, non-uncaringness, non-indifference.

### Part I: Emergence

- Tradition as intergenerational conversation, where the participants know the founder's generative questions.
- **Traditions, when vital, embody continuities of conflict.**
- Contextualist school of historical interpretation, not contextless iterations of timeless truths.
- Our embeddedness in a particular culture and its stage of development moulds our receptivity or resistance to various values and beliefs.
- Secular Buddhism as it exists today is a developmental tendency only.
- Buddha's awakening as "existential readjustment."
- **An ethos of sceptical not-knowing.**
- The four tasks enhance each other, constitute a lifelong feedback loop.
- A truth-claim should be judged by its usefulness to human wellbeing.
- The mystical does not transcend the world but saturates it.

### Part II: Western affinities

- We are not fixed entities – we are dynamic chains of events or processes.
- A favourite image for thing kind of being is the artisan ... while at work they're indistinguishable from the tools and the work they're doing.
- Constant awareness of our personal finitude is the touchstone of sanity.
- **Just process. Nothing solid. But not nothing either.**
- Secular faith has three aspects: an existential commitment to sustaining fragile but significant relationships and projects; accepting uncertainty as a basic condition; using the precariousness of every aspect of our lives as a motivational force.
- ... life just continues, now with added clarity and commitment.
- **Nirvana is a transitory mind state free of greed, hatred, and delusion.**
- **Dukkha stands for inescapable aspects of the human condition, whether we indulge in "craving" or not.**
- Practice should be vibrant, fresh, vivid.

## Part III: The inner life

- An ethic: a challenge to our self-responsibility, intelligence, sensitivity.
- **Embrace the whole of the human condition and work with it.**
- Works-in-progress unto death.
- **Perfectionism ... constitutes one of humanity's greatest frailties. It ... seeks an exist from the human condition, not an exploration and enrichment of it.**
- We still live in cultures that affirm busyness as a virtue in itself.
- **All lives contain tragic elements, and we have to receive them in our sits as we would any other experience.**

### Part IV: Practising with others

- Sangha is a process of being-with-others, not a resource.
- Each of us must own – and seek to identify and overcome – our sangha's shortfalls.
- Our sangha must have humour pumping through its veins.

### Part V: Dharmic citizenship

- Act generously, compassionately and fairly towards others, including strangers in need.
- Society is a compact between the dead, the living, and the as-yet unborn.
- 'Democratic socialism' denotes a progressive development trend, not any sort of end state.
- **Secularity eschews revelations and beliefs about entities and forms of existence outside of time.**
- **Secularity insists that thought and practice should address particular times and circumstances.**
