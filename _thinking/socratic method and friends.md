## Gathered strands

- Help people develop their understanding
- Question to determine consistency and coherence
- Question to bring everyone closer to the truth
- "The unexamined life is not worth living"
- cross-examining, testing, scrutiny
- Iterative process. Question, refine, question again.
- Acknowledging the role a person's causes and conditions determine their judgments, opinions, their idea of truth

## [Socratic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method)
 
also known as the method of Elenchus or Socratic debate) is a form of argumentative dialogue between individuals based on asking and answering questions

In Plato's dialogue "Theaetetus", Socrates describes his method as **a form of "midwifery"** because it is employed to help his interlocutors **develop their understanding** in a way analogous to a child developing in the womb. The Socratic method begins with commonly held beliefs and scrutinizes them by way of questioning to **determine their internal consistency and their coherence with other beliefs** and so to **bring everyone closer to the truth**.

"The unexamined life is not worth living"

Elenchus (Ancient Greek: ἔλεγχος, romanized: elenkhos, lit. 'argument of disproof or refutation; cross-examining, testing, scrutiny esp. for purposes of refutation'[5]) is the central technique of the Socratic method. (not quite my style: not for the purposes of refutation)

Socrates (as depicted by Plato) generally applied his method of examination to concepts such as the virtues of piety, wisdom, temperance, courage, and justice.

Socrates said that his awareness of his ignorance made him wiser than those who, though ignorant, still claimed knowledge.

Socrates ... claimed that the chief goodness consists in the caring of the soul concerned with moral truth and moral understanding

One elenctic examination can lead to a new, more refined, examination of the concept being considered (yas, iterative)

## [Academic skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_skepticism)

Unlike the existing school of skepticism, the Pyrrhonists, they maintained that knowledge of things is impossible. Ideas or notions are never true; nevertheless, there are degrees of plausibility, and hence degrees of belief, which allow one to act. 

They were consistent enough to extend their doubt even to their own principle of doubt, making their skepticism universal, thus escaping reproach for basing it upon a fresh dogmatism

## [Pyrrhonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhonism)

Pyrrhonism is an Ancient Greek school of philosophical skepticism which rejects dogma and advocates the suspension of judgement over the truth of all beliefs. 

Pyrrhonism is best known today through the surviving works of Sextus Empiricus

The goal of Pyrrhonism is ataraxia,[5] an untroubled and tranquil condition of soul that results from a suspension of judgement, a mental rest owing to which we neither deny nor affirm anything

## [Protagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagoras)

Protagoras seems to have meant that each person's own personal history, experiences and expectations, developed over their lifetime, determine their judgments, opinions, and statements regarding "truth"  (cf causes and conditions in Buddhism)

it was part of Protagoras' point that the statement is somewhat counterintuitive. He argued that believing that others' opinions about the world are valid and must be respected, even if our own experience of truth is different, is necessary for a community to base itself and its decisions on open, democratic debate.

Protagoras also said that on any matter, there are two arguments (logoi) opposed to one another

Agnosticism

Protagoras was a proponent of either agnosticism or, as Tim Whitmarsh claims, atheism, on the grounds that since he held that if something is not able to be known it does not exist

## [Gadfly (philosophy and social science)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadfly_(philosophy_and_social_science))

A gadfly is a person who interferes with the status quo of a society or community by posing novel, potentially upsetting questions, usually directed at authorities.

## [Devil's advocate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_advocate)

The advocatus diaboli (Latin for Devil's advocate) is a former official position within the Catholic Church, the Promoter of the Faith: one who "argued against the canonization (sainthood) of a candidate to uncover any character flaws or misrepresentation of the evidence favoring canonization".[1]

In common parlance, the phrase "playing devil's advocate" describes a situation where someone, given a certain point of view, takes a position they do not necessarily agree with (or simply an alternative position from the accepted norm), for the sake of debate or to explore the thought further using valid reasoning that both disagrees with the subject at hand and proves their own point valid.
