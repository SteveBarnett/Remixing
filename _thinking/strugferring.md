## Summary of sorts: Strugferring

(Strugferring = Struggling + Suffering. Pronounce with a wet g for most humorous effect.)

Suffering and struggle go together in a human life to create meaning and growth.

Suffering and happiness exist together. We can transform our suffering into understanding, compassion, and joy for ourselves and for others.

- Impermance. Reality is in constant motion. Things change.
- This creates dukkha, suffering, dissatisfaction, uneasiness. We move to rebalance, restabilising, settle.
- More intense periods of suffering promote growth, from the energy caused by the gap between states.

## Suffering

The First Noble Truth is "Life is suffering." Or "There is suffering". Or "Life has suffering".

I don't read this as "Life is only suffering" or "Life is always suffering."

- An important Buddhist belief is that all existence is impermanent. To me that says there can't be such a thing as Truth in the absolute sense. (Although I think there can definitely be more true and less true things).
    - Same but different angle: Reality is in constant flux and motion. Any "Truth" is provisional, a process, like all things.
- The Buddha was known to be a radical empiricist. He told people something he had discovered, something he believed, and said "Test this against your own experience." (Impermanence is one of the most easily and readily tested ones.)

I try and hold the "Truth" part lightly, somewhat by the same reasoning.

- There's also a rhetoric-related angle for me. To catch people's attention you need a fairly strong statement. Calling it a Truth perks up ears more than a phrasing that's softer and more nuanced.
- There's also a "concepts in general (and language in particular) collapse Reality" angle. Reality is made up of a infinite causes and conditions. Of course it's impossible to taste an always and everywhere Truth. But language and ideas are what we have to communicate, so we use them.

Although "suffering" is the most common translation of *dukkha*, other ones include "unsatisfactoriness" or "unease". For humans, applied to the psychology layer: things change, and we don't want them to. I think this is also true on a biological level. Although there are many processes (like osmosis or homeostasis) that tend to balance and stability, they never stay there. There is no animal that is never hungry, or never sleepy.

The book "Why Buddhism Is True" talks about this from a Natural Selection angle. Natural Selection's "design goals" are to focus first on goals bringing pleasure, and that pleasure shouldn't last forever.

In "No Mud, No Lotus" Thich Nhat Hanh says that suffering and happiness are not separate. Where there is no suffering, there can be no happiness, and vice versa.

## Struggle

Growth requires energy. Any gap between a current state and a desired state requires change, action. That often involves some kind of struggle.

Hunger requires eating. There's a built-in system in animals (and plants) that tilts us towards acquiring more energy to keep going.

Muscles need resistance to grow. The weight, the resistance, need to be "a bit too much" so that some effort and strain is involved. That's what sends the signals to the body to promote new growth.

"No Mud, No Lotus" Thich Nhat Hanh: we can transform our suffering into understanding, compassion, and joy for ourselves and for others.

Learning happens when we have to exert effort to acquire new knowledge and skills. I contracted at a really great place that did maths practice exercises. One of the key features of the product was the dynamic difficulty. The key was that success rate for the student shouldn't be 100%. (I think the sweet spot was something like 2/3 or 4/5 success.) The gap created energy, impetus. Related: as schools of thought like Taoism or Stoicism say: avoid excess, practice moderation.

This applies to difficult life situations too. We have a drive to survive. Resistance, struggle, promotes growth. That doesn't imply we should put ourselves in, or wish for, terrible situations. It's more like: when they do happen, we will usually rise to the challenge in some way. 

Related: often people who have been through big struggles and survived (for example: cancer, or a serious accident) say it was the best thing that ever happened to them. They draw meaning from it. Note that they don't wish the same experience on other people, or wish for something similar to happen again.

- Part of this is the human story-making brain, finding a way to survive something deeply painful and traumatic.
- Part of it is that this is what a fully-lived human life is like. One without any ups and downs would be flat, lifeless, meaningless.
- Part of it is that this big gap, taking a big hit, is what promotes growth.

Big struggle events can also increase the sense of meaning and connection and other positive feelings. Other intense experiences, often dangerous, can often have the same effect. There is a casual link between the positive feelings and the intensive, often struggle, event. And, the heightened senses and emotions make the positive things more intense.

However, I think it's a mistake to assume that the best way to get those positive feelings again is a repeat of the initial experience. For example, a war reporter may find their appreciation and gratitude for life and the people around that much increased after coming home from the war zone. That does not mean that going back a war zone is the best way to get those feelings again. Additionally, habituation will have an impact in lessening both sides.
