Off the back of [a review of the year](/thinking/2023-year-in-review/), and some thinking about [my bigger picture philosophy](/thinking/my-philosophy/), I scribbled a big buncha notes.

## Practice

My theme for 2024 is going to (try and) be **rest**.

> "I well get more rest, be more at rest, and leave the rest aside."

Resting and relaxing is something I have not been doing very well during 2023.

Some things that I find relaxing: meditating, cooking, sketching, walking, arting, reading, music(k?)ing.

## Philosophy

I keep finding myself being drawn back to **Zen** and **Daoism**. I'm going to dig more deeply into Zen this year, leaning more towards it than psychology or philosophy or nonduality or Buddhism more broadly.

I'll be focusing on (what I will call pig) Zen:

- **H**ealth (engaging and unifying body and mind);
- **A**rt (creating in a wholehearted, flow, state);
- **M**indfulness (the sacredness of ordinary, everyday, acts).

I'm keeping notes from reading at [thinking/Zen](/thinking/zen/).

## Tracker

A short record of what I've done, and what I plan to do next.

I'm aiming for a specific topic for each month, to keep myself focused.
