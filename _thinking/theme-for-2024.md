Off the back of [a review of the year](/thinking/2023-year-in-review/), and some thinking about [my bigger picture philosophy](/thinking/my-philosophy/), I scribbled a big buncha notes.

## Practice

My theme for 2024 is going to (try and) be **rest**.

> "I well get more rest, be more at rest, and leave the rest aside."

Resting and relaxing is something I have not been doing very well during 2023.

Some things that I find relaxing: meditating, cooking, sketching, walking, arting, reading, music(k?)ing.

## Philosophy

I keep finding myself being drawn back to **Zen** and **Daoism**. I'm going to dig more deeply into Zen this year, leaning more towards it than psychology or philosophy or nonduality or Buddhism more broadly.

I'll be focusing on (what I will call pig) Zen:

- **H**ealth (engaging and unifying body and mind);
- **A**rt (creating in a wholehearted, flow, state);
- **M**indfulness (the sacredness of ordinary, everyday, acts).

I'm keeping notes from reading at [thinking/Zen](/thinking/zen/).

## Tracker

A short record of what I've done, and what I plan to do next.

I'm aiming for a specific topic for each month, to keep myself focused.

### January

- Rest
	- Trying longer sits.
- Health: flexibility.
	- Wing Chun stretches.
- Art: music.
	- Making longer, ambient-style, bits of music.
- Mindfulness: sacredness of the everyday.
	- Studying the basics of Zen: a bunch of introduction, instruction, and overview books.
		- Zazen form: sit like a mountain; open eyes, downcast gaze.
	- Cleaning up the kitchen immediately after cooking, before eating.
	- Making the bed immediately after getting up.

I did well with these, apart from the Art / music. I only made one track. I had a fun doing it, though, so I'm going to carry this over to February.

I've enjoyed studying and implementing Zen things. I have a handful more books that are introduction-like, so I'm going to carry this over to February too.

### February

- Rest
	- Learning and cooking some new recipes.
- Health
	- More frequent walking, preferably in nature.
	- Wing Chun exercises.
- Art
	- Reading [Chinese Landscape Painting Techniques](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21116145-chinese-landscape-painting-techniques) (an [Arty Bees Books](https://www.artybees.co.nz/) find).
	- Making longer, ambient-style, bits of music.
- Mindfulness
	- Continue studying (and immediately putting into practice) the basics of Zen.
	- Being more mindful at work.

### March or later

- Rest
	- Joining some Urban Sketchers meetups.
- Health
	- Running.
- Art
	- Practising abstract forms with a brush.
- Mindfulness
	- Reading a little on the wider context of Zen (Buddhism, Daoism, Chinese thought more broadly).
		- Read some new editions of Tao Te Ching
	- Reading some books by Charlotte Joko Beck, Pema Chödrön, Thich Nhat Hanh, and more.
	- Being more mindful at work.
	- Meditating in nature.
		- Staring at the sea.
