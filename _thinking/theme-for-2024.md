Off the back of [a review of the year](/thinking/2023-year-in-review/), and some thinking about [my bigger picture philosophy](/thinking/my-philosophy/), I scribbled a big buncha notes.

## Practice

My theme for 2024 is going to (try and) be **rest**.

> "I well get more rest, be more at rest, and leave the rest aside."

Resting and relaxing is something I have not been doing very well during 2023.

Some things that I find relaxing: meditating, cooking, sketching, walking, arting, reading, music(k?)ing.

## Philosophy

I keep finding myself being drawn back to **Zen** and **Daoism**. I'm going to dig more deeply into those this year, leaning more towards those than psychology or philosophy or nonduality or Buddhism more broadly.

## Gathering a whole bunch of rest-related things

- Don't rush to a solution. 
- Wait for a better question to arise from loose and open attention.
- Act without acting on, work without working at.
- Conquer by quiescence, by getting underneath.
- Nondual practice is nondoing, relaxing.
- Not an injunction to do, but an invitation to rest.
- Simply rest as that which is aware.
- Find peace by resting in the wider whole, of this and not-this.
- Experiencing before understanding, defining, or remembering.
- Look for yourself, at zero distance.
- Notice and orient towards the underlying unity and wholeness.
- Flow without forcing or coercing.
- Experience emotions fully, without separation or rejection, without adding anything.
- Do fewer (and fewer) things that make people (including you) miserable.
- Practice is not having a problem with the endless stream of problems.
- The feeling of self is like clenching a fist. But the inside is still empty.
- The self is causes, conditions, patterns.
- The self is a stream of dependently arising processes interacting.
- We maintain our sense of self by editing of, selecting from, experience.
- When we resist impermanence, the feeling of self intensifies.
- The feeling of self is what it feels like to be thinking without realising you're thinking.
- Take the backward step.
- The ocean, not the waves.
- Feel the profound relief of recognising no-self.
- Look for whatâ€™s looking.
- Look for the edges.
- Look for the center of experience.
- Break the illusion of separateness of anything you can notice.
- Seen in the first instant, or not at all. Before concepts, not beyond them.
- Imperfections are normal, natural, human.
- Develop a healthy relationship with your imperfections.
- See the balanced view of yourself.
- Slowly, painfully, reconcile to life.
- Recognise unhappiness, without trying to change it or fix it.
- Experience emotions fully, without separation or rejection, without adding anything.
- Everything is allowed, even resistance.
- Give everything a warm welcome.
- The ocean, not the waves.
- The first instant is before before classification, measuring, labelling.
- Anything that can be named or located can't be you: it's an object in awareness.
- Simple, Close, Do less, On the surface, Before thoughts, Immediate.
- Turn towards feelings, especially uncomfortable ones.
- Sit still and feel the discomfort.
- The intensity of the pain is equal to the intensity of the grasping.
- The greater the resistance to (inevitable) changes, the greater the pain.
