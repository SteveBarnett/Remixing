Notes from [Welcome to the Analog Renaissance: The Future Is Trust](https://schooloftheunconformed.substack.com/p/welcome-to-the-analog-renaissance)

## My notes

- AI changes and challenges our ability to trust each other
- When we're duped by an AI we call it a tech success. Before we would have called it being conned by a psychopath.
- Generative cognition is perceiving things in the real world and making expressive things from that
- It's more like regurgitative AI than generative AI
- The more we turn to AI to substitute for human generative cognition, the more we'll mistrust what we see, read, hear
- AI saturation could encourage duplicity as a normative way of life
- Refuse to compete on the machines' terms
- Leave our human mark on the things we create
- Prioritise human originality and human effort

## Raw copy-pasta

If we were using AI only for functional tasks, then we might not have to worry about anything other than functional trust. But this is not the future of AI, not as it’s being conceived by the tech leaders of our age.

And it will challenge our ability to trust each other like no other invention in human history.

... end up feeling cheated to discover they’ve been reading the eloquent words of a machine posing as human.

In the old days we might say you were conned by a psychopath. Today we call it a technological success.

Generative cognition is the uniquely human act of seeing and perceiving real things in the world, experiencing emotions about them, and then turning those sensations and emotions into words, art, and creative expression. Although we routinely hear of “generative AI”, it’s more like “regurgitative AI”,

It is not generative in the true sense, because AI has no physical eyes, ears, and sense receptors that see, hear, and perceive actual objects and energies in the world, nor any conscious spirit that subjectively apprehends these things.

AI won’t go away, but we can adopt boundaries around its use. One boundary is generative cognition: the act of producing creative or original ideas. We can choose to avoid using AI to ...

the more we turn to AI as a substitute for human generative cognition, the more we will come to mistrust the content that is presented to us.

a whole society saturated with AI could encourage duplicity as a normative way of life

We can refuse to live by technological lies, and start building outposts of human trust in the digital wilderness.

refusing to compete on the machines’ terms, and focusing instead on leaving our own, distinctively human mark on the things we’re creating

Our position is not that all AI is bad, but if we want the benefits of this technology to outweigh the costs, then we must prioritize human originality and human effort in our classrooms, workplaces, and personal lives.
