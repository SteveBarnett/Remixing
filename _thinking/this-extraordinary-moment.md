From [This Extraordinary Moment by John Astin](https://www.johnastin.com/books)

### Introduction

My second book, This Is Always Enough (2008), explored the ways in which what we are searching for is already present, that every momentary perception, every experience, is full and complete beyond measure

### Preface

all experiences, from the most painful to the most sublime, transcend any and all attempts at mapping or modeling them

### Suggestions for How to Approach This Book

It is this very assumption—that we know what experiences actually are—that the inquiries in this book invite us to question.

start with what’s actually present, prior to any abstractions about its apparent implications

### Two Approaches to Happiness

learning to live life artfully or skillfully. If you liken life to a dream, this first approach can be thought of as learning to dream the best dream possible

in this second approach, we simply inquire into the nature of the dreaming itself

when it comes to manifesting the best possible waking dream, there appear to be significant limits. Which brings us back to approach two...

things aren’t merely what our descriptions tell us they are. They are much more than the labels we give them.

present in every moment of experience, irrespective of the conventional labels we may give it, a well-being that is just as present in sadness as it is in joy.

### The Impressionistic Nature of Experience

### The Misinterpretation of Experience

Feel into any experience and what’s discovered is that there’s so much more there—more texture, more subtlety, more depth, more mystery

### Cognitive Fusion

To put it bluntly, we suffer psychologically, not because we have certain experiences, but because of what we imagine those experiences to be

Cognitive defusion entails recognizing that our thoughts about whatever is happening are not the same as the experience itself because those thoughts represent a gross oversimplification of whatever is occurring experientially

### The Map Is Not the Territory

while you don’t need to stop interpreting, you can see the interpretations as interpretations and stop mistaking them for truth

### What Is Experience Made Of?

there really is no final answer to this question of what experience is made of but only ever this endless free fall into the unfathomable mystery of it all.

### The Partiality of All Explanations

### It’s Not What You Think It Is

the problem is that we mistake our linguistic, conceptual approximations of reality for reality

### Dialogue: The Uses and Limitations of Language

Just because we have names for things doesn’t mean we definitively know what those things are

### Reality, the Greatest Drug of All

it may even seem quite dull or boring at times (or much of the time). It may appear as if nothing is going on that we would call extraordinary or awe-inspiring. But could it be that we’re not looking carefully enough

### The Confirmation Bias

Experience is simply too complex to be understood by the thoughts that are generated about it; there is just too much detail, too much information, too much complexity, too much nuance, too much subtlety to accurately render this moment via the mechanism of thought

### Distinguishing Thought from Experience

This mistaking our conceptual rendering of reality for reality turns out to be the source of much of our confusion

### Categories

feel what is actually present in the field of experience, this explosion of light, color, sound, and energy, this wildly unpredictable, uncontrollable dance of flickering sensations, memories, thoughts, feelings, and images

perceptual censorship enables us to create the myriad abstract, conceptual categories we are all quite familiar with

only by censoring or overlooking its uniquely distinctive features are we able to categorize anything.

### Dialogue: Discovering the Common Denominator

a well-being that has no opposite

presence is not dependent upon whatever experiential content may be showing up. We can realize that sorrow is no less present than joy or that frustration is no less present than satisfaction.

the experiential recognition that this is the case, that presence is here and can never depart, can and will fade, just as all experiences inevitably do.

### Interpretive Frameworks

never the same as its incomprehensibly rich and complex actuality.

the profound mystery that is every momentary perception

### Experience Deviates from Our Interpretations

### The Vast and Indescribable Nature of Experience

what we call experience also come with no narrative attached

### Dialogue: Are You

### Saying That Suffering Isn’t Real

the non-narrative, nonconceptual dimensions of experience

the view of inconceivability

outside the realm of any interpretive framework

frees us up to encounter them much more open-endedly, more flexibly and less rigidly

the non-narrative dimensions of experience

we’re encountering some difficult thing, countless other phenomena are occurring within the field of experience that have absolutely zero connection to the event we’re labeling as painful or difficult

### Relaxing All Effort

And now, relax all effort to relax, and simply be

### Don’t Do Anything About This

let it be completely okay to not do anything about whatever may be appearing—no need to notice it, remain mindfully aware of it, describe it, accept it, or whatever you imagine ought to be done.

### Refer to Nothing

### The Continuous Discontinuity

this is the nature of experience, to disappear no sooner than it has appeared

another order of well-being altogether, one discovered not in the usual way we label our experiences, but rather in the flow of experiencing itself

the continuous flow of perceiving itself, a flow that is by its very nature uninterrupted

### Mindfulness Is Unavoidable

### Sitting on a Chair Isn’t Merely Sitting on a Chair

What is that concept pointing to in direct experience

### Let Yourself Be Astounded

### Dialogue: The Room

the nature of experience, to ceaselessly transform itself into something else.

as we know all too well, things frequently don’t cooperate with or conform to the way we wish they would be

### Let the Winds Blow

look at the universe itself, of which we are obviously a part—stars exploding, galaxies expanding, meteors colliding, storms erupting—it isn’t really a quiet or peaceful place, is it? Given this, could it be that the effort to calm all this wild activity down is a fool’s errand?

all that dynamic energy and oftentimes chaotic

unpredictable movement was never actually the problem you imagined it to be. It’s just the nature of life to be that alive, to spin and whirl and dance with complete freedom and abandon, uncontained and explosive

### Boundaries

investigating our own direct experience to see if we can actually find any direct evidence to support the substantiality of these apparent boundaries we’ve come to believe in so unquestioningly

If such a division actually exists, you ought to be able to locate it, right? If it’s real, it should be findable, this line we imagine is separating one moment from the next

> 👆 Note: SB: I'm not actually sure I agree with this. The problem could be with our limited sense and perception apparatus.

only a seamless flow of perceiving occurring

> 👆 Note: SB: ah, there it is, I think

the perceiver and perceived co-arise

### Reality: Virtual, Actual…or Both?

What appears in the field of experience is beyond any and all descriptions or conceptualizations, even if aspects of language are able to hint at the myriad qualitative and textural dimensions of things

the mind’s job is to reduce all of this unthinkably rich complexity, depth, and detail into a single word or concept. But just notice what an impossible task that actually is.

### Everything Is Present

There’s no need to favor one thing over another

there is simply what’s present

you never have to bring

yourself back to presence because wherever you may venture within the vast field of experience, presence announces its presence as that very experience

### The Phenomenal Nature of Phenomena

### The Mystery of Intention

turns out upon closer examination to be a vast, fathomless mystery, impossible to locate, impossible to pinpoint, impossible to grasp hold of or define.

### Not Privileging Thought

this privileging of thinking over other modes of experiencing such as hearing, seeing, feeling, or sensing is completely arbitrary

everything is equal: equal in its importance, equal in its richness and meaningfulness, equal in its miraculous, unfathomable vitality and presence

### What’s True About This?

what if instead of deferring to what others have told us about what the reality of experiencing is, we simply let experience itself tell us what it is? The

let experience itself tell you what it is, speaking to you in its own unfathomable yet ever-present language

### This Is It

### Resting as the View

This isn’t about finding and then resting in the view but rather seeing that there is no possibility of ever being out of the view

### The Ease of Being Here

### The Miracle of Perceiving

What is being seen, heard, and felt is in a state of constant flux. This is the dynamic, non-static nature of everything

The flow of experiencing is ongoing. It is the sole constant

simply appreciate the fact that experiencing is even happening at all.

### Expressions of Energy

the hum of being

### We Have Not Been Here Before

### Everything Slips Away

simply notice how everything slips away

Feel the wondrous freedom of this, the impossibility of ever holding on to anything.

### The Knowing of This Moment Is the Feeling of It

### Being Here Now

As I see it, meditation is a trick we can use to discover that meditation isn’t actually necessary

There is no escaping the reality of this.Notice how powerless we are to leave this moment

There is no escaping here, for whatever we might think of or call “there” could only ever be experienced here

### Presence

sparklingly alive presence

### Drifting Toward Reality

drifting is what experience actually does owing to its inherently

dynamic, transitory nature

we may not only be fighting a losing battle but also reinforcing the notion that some portions of the experiential field are somehow preferable or more real than others

> 👆 Note: SB: not being able to finally completely win is not a good reason not to fihht. It's the ongoing process that's the thing.

### The Problem of Oversimplification

there is no drifting away from reality for there is only reality, forever drifting into itself

the sum total of that person’s qualities, not merely those they are the most likely to exhibit

categorize a person according to some personality typology or characterize them by some other psychological or biological classificatory system, we are by necessity oversimplifying who and what they are

The problem, however, lies in unquestioningly adopting any framework, whether it’s based on science, philosophy, or religion

language itself—the very medium through which the various forms of knowledge are transmitted—is also, by its very nature, reductionist

our experiences are made up of very specific details and not generalities, which are always abstractions about those specifics

### Signal and Noise

In the final analysis, any modeling of reality will necessarily be an oversimplification

appreciate how vast, how boundless, how endless the field of experience actually is.

Can you sense how nonlinear and nonrational so much of that movement of mind is, the flashing, flickering, shimmering, ephemeral nature of it 

### What Is Awareness?

### Dialogue: The Miracle of Everything

### Wide Open

openness is always and already the nature of every moment, even those we conceive of and experience as more "closed down"

notice how open everything is, how experience has no borders, no edges, no lines delineating or

distinguishing one thing from the next.

### No Hierarchy

### Time

### The Freedom of Uncertainty

### Dialogue: The World Is Made of Verbs

### The Bottomless Well of Infinity

### The Borderless Field of Being

can you find anything there, any point where the field of being comes to an end

### No Distractions

Let it be perfectly okay that the mind does whatever it does, goes wherever it goes, moves however it moves

### The Olympic Athlete Model of Spirituality

### Dialogue: The Many Flavors of Here

### Everything’s a One-Off

### Awareness Is Experience

look to see if this purported separation between awareness and its experiential content can actually be found.

awareness and the experiences it reveals co-arise. They are really a single movement; you never find one without the other

The knowing and the known, the subject and the object, the perceiver and the perceived, seemingly distinguishable as two things and yet ultimately an indistinguishable whole.

### The Fullness of Experience

### The Surface Is the Deep

### Overdramatizing the Path

### Identity and the Body of Experience

### What Are We?

### The Impossibility of Measurement

We can never pin down the precise beginning, middle, or end of any experiential state

### Many Flavors, One Taste

### Experience Doesn’t Matter

### The Magic Show

### Everything Is What You Want

### The Indescribability of Everything

### It’s Exactly What You Think It Is…and So Much More

distinctive textural quality

### Epilogue: This Life That Is Also Death

Buddhism refers to it as “suchness,” the sheer existence or beingness of everything
