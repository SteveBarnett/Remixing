Gathering some bits from old notes.

## Notes for now

Things I'd like to keep more front of mind.

- Decisive pen pulls
- Thumbnails to warm-up
- First do the big element shapes

### Tools

- Pull the pen, don't push it
- Short, decisive, lines, one at a time
- Overlap of lines and shapes is fine: aiming for realistic not perfect

### Technique

- Practice in the margins, warm up with thumbnail sketches
- Start with light guidelines, establish the big elements and shapes
- Continue with the focal point
- Add things in a balanced way

## Older notes from books

Focusing on buildings, not people or motion so much for now.

### Drawing Buildings And Cities

Drawing is about seeing, studying, analysing, finding the essential / fundamental.

#### Tools / Techniques

- Pull the pen, don't push it
- Decisive lines, not sketchy or fuzzy
- Draw shapes as lines, not in one go, slight overlap is fine
- Do hatching with lots of lines, not one long scribble
- Strong contrast
- Practice in the margins

#### Techniques

1. Light setup guidelines
2. Establish the elements
    - Start with the focal point
    - Outline the foreground
3. Add things in a balanced way
4. Add detail, contrast, depth
    - Not too much!

#### Sighting

- Sight sizing, early and often
- Sighting angle, hold your pen up
- Sighting proportions, use them for size

### The Complete Urban Sketching Companion

#### Key I: Composition

- Use the rule of thirds
- Warm up with thumbnail sketches
- Start with the big shapes
- Choose a frame
- Compose with sharp angles

### Key II: Scale

- Realistic, not perfect
- Find a basic unit to measure against
- Add people to create a sense of scale
- Use "urban furniture" to emphasise proporations
