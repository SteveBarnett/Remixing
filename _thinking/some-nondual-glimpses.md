Glimpses of the when the sense of self falls away, of when the sense of separation falls away.

- When something "bad" doesn't feel bad. Like a cold, rainy, day isn't bad weather: it's just cold and rainy.
- When everyday things feels sacred, wonderful, and precious.
- When things in the world feel fresh, new, and vivid.
- When I feel childlike, surprised, joyful.
- When I do something stupid in public, but feel no embarrassment, and just move on.
