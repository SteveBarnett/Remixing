Live a good enough ordinary life.

## Human being

- You are human, so the process of growth, maturation, is never done.
- No human can be always compassionate and insightful and generous.
- Imperfections are normal, natural, human.
- Develop a healthy relationship with your imperfections.
- See the balanced view of yourself: your patterns and human imperfections; your basic innate goodness. - Everyone's good qualities are partly luck and partly effort.
- Making mistakes then learning, unlearning, and relearning is a good sign that you’re on a good track.
- It is a rare gift to simply meet with openness and clarity what life brings our way… We have the very mistaken belief that it’s simply not enough.
- Would you ever treat a friend like this?

## The path

- Gentle, honest, self-inquiry helps you soften up, lighten up, wake up.
- Slowly, painfully, reconcile to life.
- Recognise that the causes and conditions of your life have made you like this.
- Notice that struggling against who you are doesn’t work, doesn’t help, and causes damage.
- Over time, as we ripen, we are more and more able to meet situations that we might have considered a burden as opportunities to engage.

## The practice

- Sit down in silence and simply be present. Do nothing else.
- Resist nothing. Just be. Be still.
- Let go. Don’t push, don’t pull. Make space.
- Sit still and feel the discomfort.
- Eventually, everything settles. The energy smooths out.
- Recognise unhappiness, without trying to change it or fix it.
- Everything is allowed, even resistance.
- Give everything a warm welcome.
- Recognise and accept your suffering. 
- Find peace by resting in the wider whole, of this and not-this.
- Experience emotions fully, without separation or rejection, without adding anything.
- When we stop running away and open to simply being here, the problem dissolves along with the “me” - who seemed to have it.
- Come home to the present moment. Right Now I’m Aware Of.
- Take care of all the parts of who you are.
- The things that are most difficult for us almost always have the most to teach us.
- Meditation is not about getting somewhere but about being where we are.

## Suffering

- Let problems support your practice, enhance your ability to respond appropriately.
- Meet life as it is, not as you want it to be, as it “should” be. 
- If you try to avoid something, it’s still affecting you.
- We run away from suffering, we’re nudged into doing by grasping and resisting.
- Recognise suffering, without trying to change it, or add anything.
- Recognise the suffering, then take care of it, embrace it, cradle it with tenderness.
- When we learn to acknowledge, embrace, and understand of our suffering, we suffer much less.
- Turn towards feelings, especially uncomfortable ones.
- When a painful emotion comes up, stop whatever you’re doing and take care of it.
- Meet your edge and soften. Invite yourself, don’t demand.
- The intensity of the pain is equal to the intensity of the grasping.
- Suffering and happiness are not separate. Where there is no suffering, there can be no happiness, and vice versa.
- If you can recognise and accept your pain without running away from it, you will discover that joy can be there at the same time.
- The way to be liberated from suffering is to be quickly absorbed into it.
- Don’t ignore your suffering. Just allow the positive seeds already there to get attention and nourishment.
- When we learn to acknowledge, embrace, and understand of our suffering, we suffer much less.
- The function of mindfulness is to recognise the suffering, then take care of it, embrace it, cradle it with tenderness.

## Thinking

- Thinking is something the universe is doing in the form of human beings.
- We don’t have to substitute positive labels for the negative ones, but what if we have no labels or - ideas about these occurrences at all?
- Very often, thinking—and believing what thought tells us—is the source of immense human suffering and confusion.
- Let go our of wrong ideas and perceptions about reality.
- Our idea of happiness can be the main obstacle keeping us from happiness.
- Question our beliefs about what we think our life should be and to turn our effort toward full presence of how it is.

## From my Metta practice

- I find it easy to direct metta outwards.
- I find it powerful when I imagine someone directing metta at me.
    - I find it very powerful when it's a mirror of something I find easy to give someone else.
- I find it very difficult to direct metta at myself.
