<h2>Self as another perception</h2>

<p>We know that our senses, our brains, already filter reality. This becomes especially clear when we compare our senses to other animals.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our <strong>eyes</strong> can only <strong>see</strong> light in certain wavelengths.</li>
  <li>Our <strong>ears</strong> can only <strong>hear</strong> sound in certain frequencies.</li>
  <li>Our <strong>nose</strong> can only <strong>smell</strong> certain odours, and only at high enough concentrations.</li>
  <li>Our <strong>tongue</strong> can only <strong>taste</strong> certain flavours, and only at high enough concentrations.</li>
  <li>Our <strong>bodies</strong> can can only feel <strong>touch</strong> sensations at high enough levels of pressure and temperature.</li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps it makes sense that our <strong>mind</strong> can only <strong>think</strong> certain thoughts. There are limitations that apply to the sense of thought. Our minds are constructing something, based on the available, limited, data.</p>

<p>Buddhism suggests that the mind and the mental objects are another sense.</p>

<h2 id="self-as-illusion">Self as illusion</h2>

<p>If we do take mental objects as another sense-like phenomenon, it's easy to see how it might be an illusion. Or, at the least, not quite "true", not quite a representation of reality.</p>

<p>Illusions show how the mind organises and interprets sense data. They show what assumptions the brain is making. Cognitives biases show how we make errors in judgements or decision-making when using mental shortcuts. Considering these two things, it seems plausible that things our brains do can be "a bit off" sometimes. Perhaps the sense of a concrete, fixed, separate, self is a bit off. Perhaps the self, if it's anything, is the context of awareness, and not its contents.</p>
