<div class="boxout">
Slow your tempo to stay more centred.<br>
Notice that all this movement is happening in stillness.<br>
Thoughts are movement. Stillness is before thoughts.
</div>

- Any seeking is, by its nature, taking you away from the centre / now / here.
- Movement is not-stillness. Movement is intrinsically away from stillness.
- The context of consciousness is still, the contents is moving.
- A few other poles:
    - one vs many;
    - simple vs complex;
    - subject vs object(s);
    - whole vs pieces;
    - connected vs divided;
    - quick vs slow;
    - quiet vs noisy;
    - accepting vs resisting;
    - zoomed out vs zoomed in.

- Life in the world is motion. 
- Impermanence: things are constantly arising and passing away.
- Slow your tempo.
