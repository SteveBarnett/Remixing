## [Right Speech Reconsidered - The Eightfold Path - Tricycle.org](https://tricycle.org/article/family-dharma-right-speech-reconsidered/)

> Right Speech, also called Wise Speech or Virtuous Speech, gives rise to peace and happiness in oneself and others.

The Buddha called these [the five precepts] for ethical conduct “The Five Gifts,” because by undertaking these trainings we offer a supreme gift to other beings and to ourselves: the gift of freedom from fear, hostility, and oppression.

In addition to being one of the Five Precepts, Right Speech is also one of the components of the Noble Eightfold Path.

**“Right”** is not a moral judgment to be contrasted with bad or wrong, but means **“leading to happiness for oneself and others.”**

The Buddha was precise in his description of Right Speech. He defined it as “abstinence from false speech, abstinence from malicious speech, abstinence from harsh speech, and abstinence from idle chatter.” In the vernacular this means not lying, not using speech in ways that create discord among people, not using swear words or a cynical, hostile or raised tone of voice, and not engaging in gossip. Re-framed in the positive, these guidelines urge us to **say only what is true**, to **speak in ways that promote harmony** among people, to **use a tone of voice that is pleasing, kind, and gentle**, and to **speak mindfully in order that our speech is useful and purposeful**.

Mindfulness makes it possible to recognize what we are about to say before we say it, and thus offers us the freedom to choose when to speak, what to say, and how to say it.

The teaching about Right Speech assumes imperfection. **Our “mistakes” are a vital part of our learning.**

Right Listening is what Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh calls “deep listening.” It is what physician Rachel Naomi Remen calls “generous listening,” what Buddhist teacher and Hospice trainer Joan Halifax calls “listening from the heart,” and what the Quakers call “Devout Listening.”

## [Reflections on Buddhist Right Speech and Skillful Communication](https://tricycle.org/article/buddhist-communication-right-speech/)

> A communication coach shares guidance on cultivating skillful communication habits, informed by systems theory and Buddhist principles of right speech. 

I came to see that everyone at times will find life unsatisfactory, so feeling unhappy no longer seemed as personal. Eagerly looking for ways to infuse my work with a Buddhist perspective, I examined teachings on conditioning, causality, mindful discernment, and interdependence.

right speech—communication that is respectful, accurate, and non-harming

 As we develop more awareness of our habits of speech, we step back and **become more discerning about which thoughts and feelings to express (lovingkindness, compassion, etc.) and which to simply notice and let go (hatred, stereotyping, etc.)**.

Like meditation, skillful listening—being present to each other’s thoughts and feelings without evaluation—helps open up a dialogue even when people have considerable differences.

**skillful talking encourages skillful listening**

**recognizing positive intentions**

Focusing on the insight of impermanence is another practice that enhances our relationships.

the advice of the third Zen patriarch can help: **“Life is easy for those who are not attached to their preferences.”**

systems theory overlaps Buddhist teachings in the domain of interdependence

Each part of a system is contingent upon all other parts, with things changing in ways we can’t necessarily predict or control, and at the same time, everything in a system is dynamically in balance with everything else.

**when we reflect on our interdependence, this can lead to changes that ripple throughout the system, enhancing goodwill and cooperation.**

**Both Buddhism and systems theory present causality as more than the view that one event directly causes another.**

**many causes and conditions contribute to how we feel ... It is highly unlikely that I can isolate a single variable**

the application of systems theory to the practice of communication encourages a dynamic balance between stability and change

A communication style infused with Buddhist principles and systems theory can encourage compassionate right speech, resulting in enhanced harmony and stability.
