- You (or "you") don't have to accept or allow anything. Life has already accepted and allowed it, or it wouldn't be here. Acceptance by "you" is a moot point.
- This perspective is the wrong way round. It's not you who is doing anything, including accepting or allowing. Life is doing you, the same way it does trees, birds, waves, clouds.
- Not "find and rest in the View", but "Realise there is only the View," that you're already there.
- Allow everything to be equal, including judgement of experience.
