<p>It's a subtle difference (so subtle that perhaps I'm just imagining it!) but: the bullets below are more like descriptions of the outward appearance of wu wei than instructions of how to do it / be it.</p>

<p>Acting means an agent manifesting a purpose, so the Tao doesn't act. Wu wei is spontaneous, actionless, activity. Like <a href="/thinking/zen/the-just-in-just-sitting/">the "just" in "just sitting"</a>, wu wei means acting without a goal or a motive or attachment to a particular outcome.</p>

<p>Language has evolved to implicitly include an agent, so it's hard to talk about this kind of thing!</p>
