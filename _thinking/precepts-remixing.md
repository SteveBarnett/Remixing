## Notes

I think specific positive injuctive framings ("Do this good thing") are the most fruitful. But/and multiple angles are helpful for getting the best grip on something. And negation of something can be particularly useful, such as anattā / not-self.

I really like the take in "[Good Life: A Zen Precepts Retreat](/thinking/zen/good-life-a-zen-precepts-retreat/)" of:

- Key (e.g. Gratitude); 
- Prohibition (e.g. Not killing)
- Aspiration (e.g. To live in harmony with all life and the environment that sustains it)
- Inspiration (e.g. There is not separate self)

I like links and lines and maps. So I like a mind map kind of structure:

- Value (underlying the precept)
    - Action 1 (that supports the value)
    - Action 2
    - Action 3

A few helpful angles from Opening to Oneness:

- From not to non: both stealing and not stealing have been liberated to become non-stealing.
- The precepts are not just ethical norms but rather expressions of enlightened reality.
- Not about how to be “good” and live by the precepts.
    - Rather, they challenge us to examine deeply who we are.
    - Instead of aspiring to keep the precepts, we look deeply into our failure to do so.
- Whatever we suppress in ourselves we tend to oppress in others.

## Various takes on the precepts
