A "hold it up, turn it around, look at it from another angle," on "the path is the goal".

- More like a compass, less like GPS. A directional heading, not a destination that you can arrive at.
- Like ongoing maintenance.
    - You can't breathe so much you never need to breathe again.
    - You can't sleep so much you never need sleep again.
    - You can't eat so much you never need to eat again.
- Waves in the ocean. You can lower the frequency, lessen the amplitude. But you can't get right of the waves.
