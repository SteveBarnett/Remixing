[My big theme for 2024 is rest](/themes/2024/#practice). I've been feeling like I'm not keeping that very top of mind, and that I've been getting some interesting new angles on rest from [my Zen reading and practice](/thinking/#zen).

Something to note is that I tend to be an active relaxer. My [MC SWARM](/themes/2024/#mcswarm) of things I find relaxing are more active than passive.


## SNAIW üêå

Slow down and **just** pay more detailed attention.

- **Slow** your tempo. Be patient, wait a little longer.
- **Notice** what's arising. Name the emotions and feeling tones.
- **Accept** things as they are. Give everything a warm welcome.
- **Investigate** the embodied sense of it.
- **Watch** it pass away. Let it go.

Like SNAIL, but "watch it pass away" feels like a more active framing, which works better for me.

## Slow, Accept, Open

1. **Slow your tempo.** Take a few deep breaths.
2. **Accept things as they are.** Stop pushing. Stop pulling.
3. **Open up.** Soften, and rest in the wider space of this and not-this, of awareness.

When you can't do a step, don't fight it. Just notice how it feels.

Even though the movement is a relaxation, a letting go, it still helps me, for now, to have a more active framing. I realise this is perhaps sort of missing the point.

## Summary

- Pushing/pulling, doing, thinking, creates separation, creates suffering.
- Rest in the wider space of awareness, of nonduality, of this and not-this.
    - Soften up, open up.
- Slow your tempo. Spend more time, deeper attention.

## Suffering

- Thinking, doing, running away, creates separation, creates suffering.
    - The greater the push/pull, the greater the suffering.
- Recognise your suffering.
    - Pause, sit still, feel the discomfort.

## Rest

- Rest is inclusive.
    - Rest is the wider space of awareness.
    - Give everything a warm welcome. Even resistance.
    - Allow everything to be exactly as it is.
    - Rest in the wider space of this and not-this.
    - Recognise that suffering and happiness are not separate, can coexist.
- Soften up, open up.
    - Meet your edge and soften.
- Not-doing. Not-thinking. Just be.
    - Just as in: nothing else but; only being; not turning away; no ‚Äúin order to.‚Äù
- Slow your tempo. Give more time.
- Pay more, deeper, attention.

## Active relaxing

- Deep attention is restful and restorative.
- Go for frequent, small, walks.
- Do the thing to bring about the mood; don't wait for the mood to do the thing.
