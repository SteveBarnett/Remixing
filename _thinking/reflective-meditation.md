## Raw notes

- Over time, curiosity replaces inner judgement.
- The practice is meditation and reflection and conversation together.
- The practice is a refuge for kindness and curiosity.

### 1. The basics

- Power needs its buddies: boundaries and compassion.
    - Peer groups often hope to equalise power, but often it's just drive underground instead.
    - Embedded in power dynamics is competition and scarcity.
- Let other view influence you but not dominate your perspective.
    - With **receptive listening** we grow our capacity to listen to ourselves while listening to others.
- **Feministic.** Gentleness, receptivity, relational approach, inclusivity, responsible and transparent use of power, accountable collaboration, respectful feedback.
- Seeing conditionality changes how we perceive ourself and others, how life unfolds.
    - **All things arise from myriad, ever-changing, causes and conditions.**
    - Freedom doesn't lie outside conditionality, but in perceiving it.
- Ride the waves of who and what is going on as skilfully as we can.
- **When we're feeling out of sorts, bring gentleness and kindness.**

### 2. Learning to meditate

- Hold principles and teachings as foundations, but don't let them override your individual experience.
- Be nudged towards self-honesty, kindness, and care during meditation.
- Have a safe, nutritious, space in meditation. Somewhere that arises with ease, is stabilising, comforting.
- **The language of experience draws us closer to what happened.**
    - Learning this language gives us more choice over our actions.
- **Notice the conditions that contribute to different states.**
    - We being to look upon our own, and others', life experiences with more kindness and curiosity.
    - Apathy, indifference, and hostility get worn away.
- **All experience is a story.**
    - Examine your stories, develop a nuanced relationship with them.
- Every once in a while, share your experience with a trusted friend or teacher.

### 3. Features of reflective meditation

- Learn from what happened. Do subtle experiments, not big changes.
    - Transformations that arise out of care and friendliness can be more subtle.
- Retreats can have a light schedule that is **grounding**.
- **Try meditating in various emotional states.**
- The Middle Way: bounce back and forth to find what works for you.
- Sometimes the best choice is to press on, sometimes it's to stop.
- **Become more friendly with whatever's happening.**
    - **"Free-range meditation": give your experience a big field to roam in.**
- **People's high ideals fuel their shame.**
- **In meditation we let go of a major desire: to take action.**
- Be relatively still. Something calmer develops.

### 4. Discovering the Buddhist teachings in experience

- **It's hard to value our experience when we're always trying to change it.**
- Journal about your meditation. It's impossible to remember it all, or most. Just "let it rip" when writing.
- Talk about your meditation. Group talking informs and cross-fertilises understanding.
- **We all have skin in the game when talking about something that affects us.**
- **Find relief from yearning to be different, gain curiosity about how things are.**
- Become friends with the hindrances.
- **Learn how to hold more complexity and contradictions.**
    - Not transcend daily challenges, but be with them with more awareness.
    - **When we lessen the sting, we spend less time trying to avoid it.**
- Beware of false dichotomies, like spiritual or psychological.

### 5. The teachings, the dharma

- Dharma teachings intertwine, are inseparable. But we separate them to see each one more clearly.
- The three marks of existence: we seem to know them, then keep forgetting them.
- The three conceits (higher than, lower than, equal to) arise from and reinforce the sense of self.
- Dukkha: vulnerability, dissatisfaction, **imperfection**, hurt, loss, stress.
- A possible fourth mark: needs to survive and thrive.
- **We don't go beyond the three poisons, we just become more aware of their conditions.**
- Eightfold path samma: right, useful, appropriate, helpful, skillful.
- Letting our meditative attention roam freely can make it more easy to settle and focus attention.
- Explore the tension before opposing factors.
- The four-corner argument: true; false; both true and false; neither true nor false.
    - The last one is away from judgement into just being.

### 6. What develops in reflective meditation

- We sow the seeds of kindness, gentleness, care, curiosity.
- **The path develops slowly, for most people, most of the time.**
- Wisdom and confidence that develops slowly is more reliable and steadfast.
- **Looks for the seeds of loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, equanimity.**
- **Softness, gentleness, friendliness lead to relaxation, calm.**
