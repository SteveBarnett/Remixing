An update to / remix of [The three Os of letting go(s)](/thinking/the-three-os-of-letting-go-s/).

## Should, could, good

- **Let go of the shoulds.**{: #shoulds }
    - That things **should** be different.
    - That **you** should be different.
- **Let go of the coulds.**{: #coulds }
    - That things **could** be different.
    - That **you** could be different.
- **Rest in the good(s).**{: #goods }
    - That things are **good as they are**.
    - That **you** are good as you are.

## Application

- **Noticing** loosens things some.
- **Accepting** loosens things some more.
- When you can't do a step, don't fight it. Just notice how it feels.

## Flavours of [tension](/thinking/tension/)

Applying the three uhds is a way of quietening down. But I tend to be quite high energy, and some of that comes from the tension around these.

- The tension between **what is** and **what could be** tends to give me **high energy**.
- But the tension between **what is** and **what should be** tends to give me **nervous, anxious, energy**.

These are both somewhat underpinned by the Inner Critic, leading me to dig into [some IFS-like things](/thinking/archive/#ifs).

I keep coming back to this! More recently when thinking about [Mistakes, perfection, forgiveness](/thinking/mistakes-perfection-forgiveness/). When I make a mistake: apply the three uhds. Then get to work.

Although the direct path, starting at the **good(s)** is ideal, I often find it difficult. I get really stuck on the **should**. However, I find that when I really accept the **should**, suddenly it becomes easy to let it go, and move on to the **could**. Hmm! ðŸ¤”

Over the years, I've found I'm noticing more and more the many causes and conditions that lead to my qualities, behaviours, thoughts, judgements. I've been noticing the **could** aspect more this year, especially in the last few months (Winter 2024). That has helped me notice the **should** aspect more, and how the root is essentially the same.
