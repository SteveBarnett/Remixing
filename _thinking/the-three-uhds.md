An update to / remix of [The three Os of letting go(s)](/thinking/the-three-os-of-letting-go-s/).

<div class="boxout">Should, could, good.</div>

- **Let go of the shoulds.** 
    - That things **should** be different.
    - That **you** should be different.
- **Let go of the coulds.**
    - That things **could** be different.
    - That **you** could be different.
- **Rest in the good(s).**
    - That things are **good as they are**.
    - That **you** are good as you are.

When you can't relax, let go, don't fight that. Just notice how it feels, holding on, fighting, struggling.

Although the direct path, starting at the **good(s)** is ideal, I often find it difficult. I get really stuck on the **should**. However, I find that when I really accept the **should**, suddenly it becomes easy to let it go, and move on to the **could**. Hmm! ðŸ¤”
