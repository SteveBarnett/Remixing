An update to / remix of [The three Os of letting go(s)](/thinking/the-three-os-of-letting-go-s/).

Should, could, good.

- **Let go of the shoulds.** 
    - That things **should** be different.
    - That **you** should be different.
- **Let go of the coulds.**
    - That things **could** be different.
    - That **you** could be different.
- **Rest in the good(s).**
    - That things are **good as they are**.
    - That **you** are good as you are.
