## This, not-this, both – brightly

- Notice this
- Notice not-this
- Notice the unity of the wider space of both
    - Everything is included, everything is part of life
    - No boundaries, no separation, no distance
    - Notice how brightly everything appears

## Flow, acceptance, welcome

- Watch the thoroughgoing, complete, playful flux and flow of it all
- Accept the unanswerability and unresolvability of it all
- Give everything that arises a warm welcome

## Bullets from earlier pages

- ANT: And Not-This
- Look for yourself at zero distance
- Notice the wider space that contains “this” and “not-this”
- They always exist together. The “not-this” is the backdrop to the “this.”
- Accept the wider view of everything and its opposite
- Love, compassion, expressed as the complete lack of boundaries, separation, distance
- Tune into the felt experience, before thoughts. Allow awareness to illuminate what is, let it loosen the grip.
- Waking up is a (repeated, ongoing) falling away of the persistent belief that this isn’t it
    - A process of subtraction and surrender, of letting go of more and more
- Every event is part of life. Everything is included. 
- The infinite causes and conditions of Reality create everything. From the perspective of the Absolute, there are no problems, no choices, no separation. No shoulds, no coulds, only what is.
- Giving everything that arises a warm welcome
- Being able to accept the unanswerability and unresolvability of life
- Letting go of compulsive thinking, habitual stringing together of thoughts
- Letting go of desires and attachments
- Don’t be attached to thinking or to not-thinking. Integrate the two, in a non-dual way
- Notice the emotion or thought. Notice the opposite. Notice both simultaneously. Notice the third experience.
- The whole universe is one bright pearl
- Everything in awareness appears brightly. Bright like open, luminous, clear.
- The brightness of all this, Just This.
- Everything is included, showing up together all at once
- Everything is a verb, arising and passing away without a pause
- Ongoing and complete flux and flow, the playful and bright activity of it all
