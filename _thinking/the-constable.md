I've thought of a new angle for myself on the Critic / Coach stuff. I've thought and written before a bit about [the Inner Critic](/thinking/inner-critic/), and [Grips for the Critic / Coach coin](/thinking/grips-for-the-critic-coach-coin/) (things to do, ways to get a handle on it).

I was thinking about openness and curiosity, then applied it a bit to the Critic / Coach coin. Previously I've thought about the Critic and the Coach being two sides of the same coin, with the edge of the coin being the Compassionate Observer. I struggle with self-compassion, so I was looking for the first baby step towards the Compassionate Observer. If I can't be compassionate, can I be disinterested or objective or factual? If I can't take a positive interpretation, can I at least not add a negative interpretation?

The Constable is a detective. An investigator. They don't know what's happened, or is happening. They're interested in the bare facts first, before they hear anyone's story.

I'm going to explore this Constable angle a bit more. This character framing is influenced by Internal Family Systems. [I have dug into IFS a little](/thinking/notes-from-IFS-reading/), but intend to come back to it some more.

An excellent question that the Constable might ask, short-circuiting the Critic:

> What **would** be good enough? Be specific.

## "I have questions"

The Constable is a big part of what I'm like. I like to ask questions. I like to poke. It's a bit more like sceptical and a bit less like (just) curious.

## Talk amongst yourselves

Something that came to mind after reading ["Laugh in the face of standards" on The Imperfectionist](https://ckarchive.com/b/o8ukhqhk2wxv7sp2ww025ap66mwrrho), that I don't think I've thought about before in much detail, is how the various hats (or "parts" in IFS language) **talk to each other.** It's not just that The Constable is another way of thinking about these things, but that The Constable can say "Oi!" to the Critic.

I'm considering writing up another hat / part: The Comedian. That one will have **a lot** to say to the other parts! ðŸ˜…
