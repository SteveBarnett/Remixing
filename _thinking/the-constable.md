I've thought of a new angle for myself on the Critic / Coach stuff. I've thought and written before a bit about [the Inner Critic](/thinking/inner-critic/), and [Grips for the Critic / Coach coin](/thinking/grips-for-the-critic-coach-coin/) (things to do, ways to get a handle on it).

I was thinking about openness and curiosity, then applied it a bit to the Critic / Coach coin. Previously I've thought about the Critic and the Coach being two sides of the same coin, with the edge of the coin being the Compassionate Observer. I struggle with self-compassion, so I was looking for the first baby step towards the Compassionate Observer. If I can't be compassionate, can I be disinterested or objective or factual? If I can't take a positive interpretation, can I at least not add a negative interpretation?

The Constable is a detective. An investigator. They don't know what's happened, or is happening. They're interested in the bare facts first, before they hear anyone's story.

I'm going to explore this Constable angle a bit more. This character framing is influenced by Internal Family Systems. [I have dug into IFS a little](/thinking/notes-from-IFS-reading/), but intend to come back to it some more.
