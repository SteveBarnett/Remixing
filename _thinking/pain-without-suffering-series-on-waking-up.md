(In progress)

- There is no "If I do X" that will fix it
    - (This reminds me of [the wisdom of no escape](/notes/zen/pema chodron - the wisdom of no escape.jpg) and of Koans: an unresolvable thing)
- Pain can have a softness, a tenderness, a feeling of care
- Move from reactive to creative
- You don't need to make it to next year, next month, next week, tomorrow, later today. Only this moment.
    - And by the time you've finished that thought, you have.
- Come to a more accurate perception
    - Your direct experience, before thoughts
    - The experience, before the story
- See thoughts as passing events, not tyrants or bullies
- Let experience be like water flowing through a river, not like a rock in a river.
