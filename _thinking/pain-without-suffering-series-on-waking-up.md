## Raw notes

- There is no "If I do X" that will fix it
    - (This reminds me of [the wisdom of no escape](/notes/zen/pema chodron - the wisdom of no escape.jpg) and of Koans: an unresolvable thing)
- Pain can have a softness, a tenderness, a feeling of care
- Move from reactive to creative
- You don't need to make it to next year, next month, next week, tomorrow, later today. Only this moment.
    - And by the time you've finished that thought, you have.
- Come to a more accurate perception
    - Your direct experience, before thoughts
    - The experience, before the story
- See thoughts as passing events, not tyrants or bullies
- Let experience be like water flowing through a river, not like a rock in a river.
- Sometimes it's not just one second arrow, but many, multiple
- Resisting, resenting, tightening causes suffering
- We **can't** avoid the first arrow.
- Suffering from resisting? Open, soften, yield, go closer
- Suffering from feeling overwhelmed? Broaden your attention.
- The first step is to soften your aversion to pain
- Numbing to pain also numbs us to pleasure
- Resisting pain (instead of accepting it) makes us resist pleasure, makes it more difficult to accept pleasure
- Pain can trap us in our threat response mode of flight, flight, freeze
- Mountain, Ocean, Sky
    - Body flowing like a mountain: moving, but slowly
    - Emotions spacious, like waves in the ocean
    - Mind open like the sky
