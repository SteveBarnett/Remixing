[In one of her articles](https://www.estherperel.com/blog/letters-from-esther-4), Perel quotes Dr. Howard Markman, who identifies three hidden dimensions beneath most relationship impasses:

* **power and control** (who has influence and decision-making power, who wants it, what tension is this imbalance creating);
* **care and closeness** (does this person have my back, are they coming from a good place?);
* **respect and recognition** (integrity and value â€“ is this person treating me well and honouring my contribution?).
