A few notes from [365 Tao: Daily Meditations by Ming-Dao Deng](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57859.365_Tao), focusing on rest, renewal, playfulness, liveliness.

## 23 Renewal

> City on a hill,<br>Untouched land beyond.<br>A fallow field is<br>The secret of fertility.

We need time to lie fallow. ... None of us can maintain the fertility of our beings without renewal.

## 25 Uselessness

> An ancient gnarled tree:<br>Too fibrous for a logger's saw,<br>Too twisted to fit a carpenter's square;<br>Outlasts the whole forest.

Useful tress are cut down. Useless ones survive. ... To be considered useless is the chance to love without interference and to express one's own individuality.

## 68 Creativity

> Storm breaks into pieces,<br>Clouds charge the horizon.<br>Revolving of the heavens<br>Generates all movement.

Without movement, there would be nothing created in this universe.  ... Movement is responsible for creativity.

Followers of the Tao value initiative [and] creativity.  ... giving intelligent counterpoint and harmony.

One has reached the ultimate levels of creativity when one has mastered skill so thoroughly that it can be forgotten. Look at heaven and earth. Do they think about creating the weather, the seasons, and the cycles of growing?

## 106 Carefree

> Two ducks nestled in lake-side grass.<br>Both marked by the same brilliant purple at the wing.<br>Water provides food, bath, and play.<br>What need do they have for scholarship?

Animals are perfect, without any need for long instruction. They know what to do by instinct and instruction. Tao is always there for them. It sustains them and nurtures them. There is no need for them to be specially aware of Tao or to study it.

It is only humanity that constantly divorces itself from Tao. We therefore need methods of reintegration.

## 112 Non-anticipation

> Put forth your effort<br>With no thought of gain.

Hold no expectations. 

We are to know what to expect, and yet we should allow them to appear as they will.

## 117 Attraction

Life is one endless equation of darkness, brilliance, colour, sound, fragrance, and sensation.

## 120 Openness

> Nothing is meant to be.<br>There is no predestination.

Causality, not destiny.

## 129 Uncertainty

> Kicking a pebble by the side of the road,<br>Watching it tumble pell-mell.<br>Chance and randomness become order.

Those who follow Tao are interested in accepting the fact that there is always uncertainty in the universe and working with that. For them, incorporating uncertainty into life is at the heart of Tao. that is when they feel most human.

## 130 Struggle

> Life acquires meaning<br>When we face the conflict<br>Between our desires<br>And reality.

For the majority of us, life is a series of conflicts between our inner ideas and outer constrictions. How will we test ourselves against the flexing of external circumstances?

Adversity is the tempering of one's mettle. 

## 142 Lesiure

> Bird chirp, vanguard for coming rain,<br>Dog bark skitters through twilight village.<br>Smoke raises a column through the pines,<br>Contented families dine in golden windows.

Life's pulse is gauged in the hollows, the intervals between events.

If you can find a place to retreat, you can make a life where Tao will flood into you.

## 183 Middle

> Those who attain the middle,<br>Dominate the whole.

## 232 Labels

> Don't call me a follower of Tao.

Follow the fluid and infinitely shifting Tao and experience its myriad wonders. You will want nothing more than to be empty before it–a perfect mirror, open to every nuance.

If you put labels on who you are, there is separation from Tao. As soon as you accept designations, you define yourself in contrast to the Tao.

Reject labels. Reject identities. Reject conformity. Reject convention. Reject definitions. Reject names.

## 251 Vitality

> Snail, tiny spiral in calcified membrane;<br>Inchworm, a hairpin dragon;<br>Bumblebee, blob of velvet black and yellow,<br>White butterfly, syncopated burst of gladness.

Everywhere you look in a garden there will be some dynamic event in progress.

Variety is vitality.

## 294 Sitting

> Cats sits in the sun.<br>Dog sits in the grass.<br>Turtle sits on the rock.<br>Frog sits on the lily pad.<br>Why aren't people so smart?

Those who follow Tao are fond of pointing out the wisdom of animals. When they see a cat sitting motionless in the sun or a turtle who stretches their head upward in a still poses, they say the animals are meditating.

Admire the naturalness of their actions, then think of your own life. Don't meditate because it is part of your schedule or it is demanded by your particular philosophy. Meditate because this is natural.

### 316 Rest

> Completion means rest.<br>Rest means renewal.<br>Renewal means new beginnings.

Perseverance is a great virtue, but perseverance cannot cultivated without endings. It means beginnings, middles, and ends, and then starting over again.

## 318 Singing

> Rain comes, and birds–<br>Silhouettes against the pearlescent sky–<br>Respond excitedly in song.<br>They open their throats to heaven's nectar,<br>And rhyme with the drops.

It is up to each of us to sing as we feel move by the overall song of life. Do we harmonise with it? Do we sing a counterpoint? Do we purposefully sound discordant tones?

## 339 Learning

> Learning is the fountain of youth.<br>No matter how old you are,<br>You mustn't stop growing.

As long as we continue to learn, welcome new ideas and ways of doing things, and continually expand our understanding of ourselves and the world around us, then we are engaging in the ultimate creativity of the self.

## Uninhibited

> The drunk falls from the the cart but is not hurt.<br>You throw hesitation aside but look stupid.<br>To be truly uninhibited is a rare grace.

In the beginning, our must adhere to a structure–artificial thought it may be–until one attains that proper understanding to behave with uninhibited spontaneity. ... True uninhibitedness must come as a by-product of sure, fresh, and creative actions.
