The end of suffering is not what we think it is. It's not what we **think** it is. It's not the thinking about it, it's before thought, the experience of it.

The mind creates thoughts. Thoughts are what create the gap because what is and what should or could be. But in Reality, before thought, there is only what is. There is only one Reality. Shoulds and coulds are abstract concepts, not the living unified oneness that is Reality.

"I don't like it" or "I don't want it" or "I want it and I don't have it" are all thoughts created by the mind. They create separation, a gap, that doesn't really exist.

## Truths and Marks

I feel like this is swirling around the First Noble Truth (there is suffering), Third Noble Truth (there is an end to suffering), and Impermanence as a Mark of Existence. There's no complete and final end to suffering because: everything is impermanent; there is suffering. But there can moment, pockets, of cessation of unsatisfactoriness.


## Bit of a gatherup

- Being human means always having this ongoing visceral feeling that things aren't quite right
- We think that this is a problem we can solve, but we can't find security, stability, safety
- Life's work is to face this truth, again and again and again
    - Be here with whatever arises, without picking and choosing, without trying to escape
    - Leave things as they are, without adding a label or a story
    - Experiencing this living Reality, instead of getting lost in abstract conceptual maps
- Keep letting go of persistent belief that this isn’t it
- Everything that happens is a signpost on the Path, not an obstacle to the Way

## Raw notes

- Work with what you find in the chaos of the world.
- We must work with our fears, frustrations, disappointments and irritations, the painful aspects of life.
- Embrace the whole of the human condition and work with it.

---

- Our attempts to find fixed, static, lasting states are at odds with the dynamic, processual, reality of everything and everyone
- We incorrectly believe a constant security and well-being is the ideal state
- It's part of being human to have this fundamental anxiety, this visceral feeling that things aren’t right

---

- We think having no problems is an ideal state, But it's not realistic or possible
- Thinking one day we’ll get somewhere problem-free is what keeps us miserable. 
- Cutting our expectations for a cure is a gift we can give ourselves.
- Wake up from thought-induced suffering and confusion
- Stop conflating abstract conceptual maps for experiential living reality

---

- Interrupting your thoughts
    - Refrain from keeping them going, not repress them
    - Somewhere between clinging to them and pushing them away
    - Leave things as they are, without adding a story or a label.

---

- Everything that occurs is not only usable and workable but is actually the path itself.
- A commitment to see everything we encounter, good and bad, pleasant and painful, as a manifestation of awakened energy
- Things that happen, our imperfections, are signposts on the Path, not obstacles to the Way.
- Every event is part of life. Everything is included. 

---

- Instead of trying to avoid the discomfort, open yourself completely to it
- See the feelings as road signs, barometers
- The way to dissolve our resistance to life is to meet it face to face.
- Staying with the pain of it can teach us something
- but moving feels better in the short term
- the desire to escape is very compelling
- Chasing comfort makes us avoid pain: we never see what's on the other side

---

- Meditation is about opening and relaxing with whatever arises, without picking and choosing. 
- Just be here again and again and again.
- Acknowledge, with judgement, and come back to the present

---

- Tune into the felt experience, before thoughts.
- Allow awareness to illuminate what is, let it loosen the grip.

---

- Make friends with yourself as you are, not as you wish you are, or think you out to be, honestly and kindly.
- Life's work is to find your middle way

---

- Notice the love, the joy, the wholeness of life right here in each ordinary moment
- Waking up is a (repeated, ongoing) falling away of the persistent belief that this isn’t it. 

---

- A process of subtraction and surrender, of letting go of more and more.
