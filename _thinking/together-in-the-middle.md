Perspectives from philosophy, Buddhism, and working in accessibility.

Some kind of mix of the middle way and union of (seeming) opposites.

---

Extremes, binaries, tend to be... dodgy.

- Always true or always false.
- 100% right or 100% wrong.
- Absolute or Relative.
- Emptiness or Form.
- Same or different.
- Push or pull.
- "This is perfect."
- "This changes everything."
- Never or always.

What we need is a more nuanced, broader, middle way that's more like "why can't it be both?", and "when and how does this apply?", and "what are the ranges on the spectrum?"

Not either/or, but both/and.

It seems a bit paradoxical. but only if we overthink it.

Do neither. But hold both.
