I had forgotten about "horror vacui" as an expression. I enjoy a slightly confronting turn of phrase ðŸ˜….

I was thinking about my tendency to set myself up as The Opposite. There are a couple of parts:

- keeping cultivating openness and flexibility
- deeply valuing learning, and clarity
    - learning more about both poles, in different ways
- bringing energy from the contrast (and connection from the complementary?)
- being useful, fruitful, by rushing into (what I perceive as) the empty space

## Notes

- horror vacui (Latin: horror of the vacuum) or plenism â€” commonly stated as "nature abhors a vacuum
- Flexibility, contrast, opposites, plugging holes, empty
- I like being the opposite, setting myself as the opposite
    - Partly that's about seeing what's missing to complete the picture
    - Partly that's about adding or emphasising some energy from the difference
    - Partly that's about feeling useful, fruitful
    - Not dismissing the value and importance of what's there
        - Blocks to contentment: focusing on what's wrong; focusing on what's missing.
    - Sinking in to the opposite a bit, to better understand the other pole
        - I have high energy for anything that involves learning
- Contrast as in: comparison, distinction, diversity, opposition, variation
- Complementary as in: interdependent, reciprocal, correspondent
- Form is valuable. (But/and) emptiness is useful.
- Empty like a cup before itâ€™s filled.
- ready, as in possibility.
- Like an unplanted garden, like an empty cup.
- fluid, flexible
- Reconciliation and holding together of opposites
- Not a midpoint or a collapsing of them
- the oneness of things previously believed to be different
- opposites arising together
- We notice things by contrast
- phenomenal manifestation can only appear in polarities and contrasts.
- we have qualities like height or bravery only in contrast with other things
- nothing is what it is on its own. It can only be what it is through its comparing and contrasting connections to everything else, especially its nearby connections.
- Nothing can appear without polarity and contrast.
- The Perfectionist perhaps formed as a bit of a clarity-based complementary-opposite-reaction to a model of quietness and indirectness.
- Support, as in: ancillary, assistant, complementary, contributory.
- Complementary forces, interacting to form a dynamic system.
- fluid, relative, transient, ungraspable, flexible, open.
- Open. Something like: Inclusive, Flexible, Positive, Inclusive, Spacious, Tentative, Curious.
- Always being challenged can make you become more effective, more creative, more flexible.
- Practice to get speedy, flexible, innovative responses to tricky situations.
- Tranquilising yourself deprives you of useful stimuli for conscious development.
