I'm trying to be more:

- **Relaxed**
	- Something like: Welcoming, Tentative, Patient, Connected, Content
- **Open**
	- Something like: Inclusive, Flexible, Positive, Inclusive, Spacious
- **Kind**
	- Something like: Empathetic, Generous, Supportive, Forgiving, Gentle

The *more* is an important part for me. It's not like there's a score I can achieve and be "done". It's an ongoing process. These values are more like navigational headings, directions, than a destination, a target.

It's not that I don't think about other values, just that these are ones I want to keep front of mind at the moment.
