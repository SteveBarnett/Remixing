Notes from [Open Aware Presence](https://joantollifson.substack.com/p/open-aware-presence).

- What happens when we stop all our usual activity and all our efforts to control the uncontrollable?
- Not fighting thoughts, or trying to be thought-free, but simply noticing thoughts arise, capture and hypnotise us, then pass away.
- Awareness, illuminating what is, transforms, by exposing the false and loosening its grip.
- Awareness gives us easier access to the source. Abiding in the source increases our ability to respond in new and different ways.
- The difference between heaven and hell, between nirvana and samsara, is a difference in way of being with them, of seeing them.
- Sacred: precious, infinite, worthy of our deepest attention.

## Copy, Pastes

> The kind of meditation that has interested me is not about concentration or trying to control the mind. It’s about discovering what happens when we stop all our usual activity and all our efforts to control the uncontrollable, when we drop out of the thought-realm into silence and stillness

> This isn’t about trying to stay in some thought-free state all the time, which would be impossible. Instead, it’s simply noticing how thinking bubbles up, how it captures the attention, how it hypnotizes us, how we naturally wake up from it

> It’s not about going to war with all this, but simply awaring it, seeing it for what it is. 

> Awareness is the great transformer, the alchemical power. Simply by illuminating what is, the false is exposed and gradually loses its grip and its believability—and at the same time, the ever-present source of freedom and well-being is discovered and seems to become more easily accessible. 

> It’s always right here. So this takes no effort. It’s a relaxing and letting go, a dissolving, a releasing, a care-free-ness, allowing everything to be exactly as it is. 

> This is the difference between heaven and hell, between nirvana and samsara—the circumstances are exactly the same, but the way of being with them and seeing them is different.

> the more we knowingly abide in the freshness and aliveness of open aware presence, the more an ability opens up to respond in new and different ways.

> by sacred, I mean precious, infinite, worthy of our deepest attention.
