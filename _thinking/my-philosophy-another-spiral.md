Expanding and updating [an earlier take](/thinking/my-philosophy/).

<!-- 
- The truth is immediate, close, easy, simple.
- Slow your tempo.
- Pay more attention.

## The grips

### 🎯

- Notice the causes, conditions, and patterns.
- Notice the motion, the changes. Watch it arise, watch it pass away.
- Notice the fractal nature of everything.
- Notice (the details of) the map you're using.
- Come back to the direct, embodied, experience.
- Notice the causes, conditions, patterns that make you who you are.

### 🏹

- Look for the edges, the gaps between.
- Look for what's static, fixed. 
- Remember that the map is not the territory.
- Take the more integrated picture, multiple viewpoints at once.
- Look for yourself, at zero distance.
- Leave things as they are, without adding a story or a label.

## The world

- **The cosmos is purposeful.** Value is intrinsic to Reality.
    - Utility can’t explained beauty, truth, goodness.
- **The cosmos is playful.** It's exploring and realising itself, playing hide and seek. It enjoys finding and being found, again and again.
    - 🎯 Notice the playful nature of everything.
- **Consciousness is a verb.** It's on a continuum.
    - Life is consciousness that's more concentrated. It speeds up the responsiveness of the cosmos.
	- We are the cosmos becoming more aware of itself.    

### Reality is one, indivisible, whole

There's variety and distinction, but no separation or division. 

<span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice the causes, conditions, and patterns.

<!-- Like interbeing, interdependence, no-self, emptiness. We are not in nature: we are nature. We are not doing in the world: the world is doing us, like it does plants and weather and (other) animals. -->

#### Concepts create division, layers, stages, often as poles

Concepts and language add labels, create stories.

Concepts make Reality appear abstract or mysterious or elusive.

<span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Look for the edges, the gaps between.

### Reality is flow, motion, change

Forms have flow, motion, change. 

Patterns create probabilities, not certainties.

Manifestation requires contrast to appear.

<span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice the motion, the changes. Watch it arise, watch it pass away.

#### Concepts are fixed, static

<span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Look for what's static, fixed. 

### Reality is complex, deep, rich

<span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice the fractal nature of everything.

#### Concepts flatten, simplify, exclude

<span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Remember that the map is not the territory.

### Reality is the source of all our thoughts and actions

- <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>**Look for thinker of thoughts and notice the absence.**
- <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>**Look for source of an action, a decision, and notice the absence.**

Things arise and pass away on their own. There's no free will, only the infinite causes and conditions of nature and nurture. 

Laws like gravity don’t make things happen. Something underneath them does.

Nature embodies drives, but they’re not material.

### Liberation is seeing through the illusion of there being a problem

- Nothing needs to be different to how it is.
- Nothing can be different to how it is.
- Nothing is really a problem. Concepts, including the self, and their stories create problems, confusion, suffering.
	- <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>**Notice that the need to solve the problem is a story.**
	- <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>**Notice the problem itself is a story.**
	- <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>**Notice that the self is a story.**

## The bridge

Perception is participation.

- **Who you are determines how you see determines what you see.**
	- <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice (the details of) the map you're using.
	- <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Negative Capability: remain in doubt and uncertainty. 
- **What qualities you see depends on the scale.**
	- <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Take the more integrated picture, multiple viewpoints at once.
- **Perception creates forms**
	- The senses create forms, like echoes in a valley, like ripples in a pond.

## The self

Some sense of self is functionally necessary and unavoidable.

“No-self” doesn’t mean no responsibility, no potential for change. Awareness can bring more choices and possibilities.

- **Your true nature is the context of consciousness, not the contents.**
	- <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Come back to the direct, embodied, experience.
	- <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Look for yourself, at zero distance.
- **Subject and object arise as a pair in awareness.**
    - The “doer”, “thinker,” the “author,” the “chooser”, the “self” is only an image, an idea, another thought.
- **The contents of consciousness arise in the world.** 
	- <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice the causes, conditions, patterns that make you who you are.
	- <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Leave things as they are, without adding a story or a label.
