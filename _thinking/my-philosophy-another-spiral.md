- The truth is immediate, close, easy, simple.
- Slow your tempo.
- Pay more attention.

## The world

### One, indivisible, whole

- **Reality is one, indivisible, whole.**
	- Notice the causes, conditions, and patterns.
- **Concepts create division, layers, stages, often as poles.**
	- Look for the edges, the gaps between.

Like interbeing, interdependence, no-self, emptiness. We are not in nature: we are nature. We are not doing in the world: the world is doing us, like it does plants and weather and (other) animals.

### Flow, motion, change

- **Reality is flow, motion, change.**
	- Notice the motion, the changes. Watch it arise, watch it pass away.
- **Concepts are fixed, static.**
	- Look for what's static, fixed. 

Like impermanence.

### Complex, deep, rich

- **Reality is complex, deep, rich.**
	- Notice the fractal nature of everything.
- **Concepts flatten, simplify, exclude.**
	- Remember that the map is not the territory.

## The bridge

Perception is participation.

- **Who you are determines how you see determines what you see.**
	- Notice (the details of) the map you're using.
- **What qualities you see depends on the scale.**
	- Take the more integrated picture, multiple viewpoints at once.

## The self

- **Your true nature is the context of consciousness, not the contents.**
	- Look for yourself, at zero distance.
	- Come back to Notice the direct, embodied, experience.
- **Subject and object arise as a pair in awareness.**
- **The contents of consciousness arise in the world.** 
	- Leave things as they are, without adding a story or a label.
		- Notice the causes, conditions, patterns that make you who you are.
