- Spiralling towards more clarity.
- The truth is immediate, close, easy, simple.
- Slow your tempo.

## Approach

- Choose the best-fit practice for right now.
- Have a spectrum of practices from active to relaxed.

### Acceptance

- **Give everything a warm welcome.**
- Check if anything is actually missing.
- Stop having a problem with the endless stream of problems.
- **Have fewer requirements, conditions.**
- Find a little more space.
- Notice not-this (in addition to this).

### Yield

- Do kintsugi on your pain
- **Work with, not against.**
- **Recognise, Allow, Investigate, Nuture.**

## The world

### Reality is one, indivisible, whole

#### Commentary

- Like interbeing, interdependence, no-self, emptiness.
- We are not in nature, we are nature.
- We are not doing in the world, the world is doing us, like it does plants and weather and (other) animals.
- Concepts divide, often creating pairs, poles, opposites.
- Concepts create division, layers, stages. 

#### Practice

- Indirect: look for the edges.
- Direct: notice the huge network of causes, conditions, and patterns that lead to this. 
- Notice how things exist on a spectrum, not a binary.

### Reality is flow, motion, change

#### Commentary

- Like impermanence.
- Concepts are fixed, static.

#### Practice

- Direct: Watch the motion, the changes.
- Direct: Watch it arise, watch it pass away.
- Indirect: Look for what's static, fixed.
- Indirect: Try and find the gaps between perceptions, between this and not-this.

### Reality is complex, deep, rich

#### Commentary

- Concepts flatten, simplify, exclude.
- **The map is not the territory.**

#### Practice

- Indirect: Notice there are not straight lines.
- Indirect: What are you thinking?
- Indirect: Break the chain of thoughts with direct experience.
- Indirect: Look for the form, the shape.
- Direct: Peer into the fractality.
- Indirect: Look for what's being left out of the map.

## The self

### Perception is participation

#### Commentary

- What qualities you see depends on the scale.
- Who you are determines how you see determines what you see.

#### Practice

- **Take multiple viewpoints at once.**
- Prefer the more integrated picture.
- Notice what map you're using.

### The context of consciousness, not the content

- The ocean, not the waves.

#### Commentary

- The world is in you.
- The contents of consciousness arise in the world.
- **Subject and object arise as a pair in consciousness.**
- Direct, embodied, experience.

#### Practice

- Indirect: Look for the centre of experience.
- **Direct: Look for yourself, at zero distance.**
- Indirect: Look for what's looking.
- Indirect: Take the backward step.
- Direct: Drop a story, an identity. What's left? Drop another.
- **Direct: Leave things as they are, without adding a story or a label.**
- Indirect: There's no need t be so antagonistic to the costume you're wearing.
- Direct: Keep taking off "hats" until there are none left.
- Direct: Notice the causes, conditions, patterns that make you who you are.

### Potential poles

- Vice / Virtue
- Fear / Desire
- Stress / Security

## Contractions

- SuperPerisher
- Conflict
- Feeling watched
- Feeling embarrassed
- Feeling anxious

## In arrows ↓↑→←

- **Relaxed.** Slow down.
- **Open.** Open up.
- **Clear.** Widen out.
- **Kind.** Bring in.

Simple and direct and very difficult.


## More wider, more inclusive, less discriminatory, less conditional

<div class="boxout" markdown="1">
- Have fewer requirements, conditions.
- Give everything a warm welcome.
</div>

- Throw away division, discrimination.
- The sacredness of the ordinary, the everyday.
- Be like a bridge, unconditional, undistinguishing.
- Acknowledge and embrace diversity.
- Think more widely, more inclusively.
- Why can't it be both?
- Accept the wider view of everything and its opposite.
- And not-this.
- Rest in the wider, more inclusive,view.
- Read widely, and from people you disagree with.
- Your search for happiness is what's making you miserable.
- Relax your limited ideas of happiness. See the other ideas that are already here.
- Be tentative. "I don't know."

## How to practice

- Sit hard and sit often.
- Continue training long and steadily.

## Give care

- Just illuminate bad feelings, and be patient.
- Take care of your suffering, be absorbed into it.
- Accept, recognise, transform, your suffering.
- Respond openly, with reverence.
- Give everything a warm welcome.

## As it is

<div class="boxout" markdown="1">
- Do less, add less.
- Leave things as they are, without the story or the label.
- This truth is simple, close, immediate.
</div>


- Meet life as it is.
- Accept all your experience, not just some of it.
- Be free in the midst of it all.
- Let go. Don't push. Don't pull.
- Grasping creates suffering.
- Water a seed to make it grow. Stop watering it to let it die.
- Drop the story.
- Leave everything in its place.
- Reject all attachments.
- Don't search for the truth, only cease to cherish opinions.
- Stop the work of classifying, labelling.

The truth is less: simpler, closer, at the surface, before thoughts, more immediate.

## Wu wei

<div class="boxout" markdown="1">
- Let things arise, let things pass away. Let things happen.
- Slow your tempo.
</div>

- Act without acting on, work without working at.
- Nothing's worse than attack what yields.
- Work with, not work against.
- Where the pot's not is where it's useful.

## Consciousness

- Consciousness is a flow that permeates reality.
- Consciousness is a verb. Beauty, truth, goodness are adverbs of it.
- Consciousness is the universe looking at itself.
- Value is intrinsic to reality. We dis-cover values, fulfil them, not create them.

## No-self

<div class="boxout" markdown="1">
Our true nature is the context of consciousness, bright and open and empty and boundless.
</div>

- The true self is open, spacious, empty, luminous, formless, boundless.
- The sense of self is a construction, a fabrication, a deception.
- Anything you can perceive is no the perceiver.
- Look for yourself, at zero distance.
- Take the backwards step.
- Our true nature is the context of consciousness, not the content.
- When the self gets out of the way, compassion manifest readily and easily.
- The self is causes, conditions, patterns.
- We maintain our sense of self by editing of, selecting from, experience. By resisting impermanence.
- Our true nature is “I am” before adding anything, before looking backwards or forwards, before classification, measuring, labelling, before concepts. 

## The Middle Way

<div class="boxout" markdown="1">
- Hold multiple viewpoints at once. They're different descriptions and angles.
- Close in, far out.
</div>

- Sometimes the average.
- Sometimes the taut tension from holding both opposites at once.
- Sometimes like an eclipse.

## Impermanence

Watch the flow, the motion, the changing, the impermanence in action.

- Reality is flow, motion, process.
- Reality is process and fields that collapse into things.
- Resistance to the flow brings complexity, forms.
- Rest and watch the changes, the swirls, the flow.

## Embodied and direct

- The felt answer, not the thought.
- More important things need to be understood through experience and embodiment, not language and concepts.

## Perception is participation

- What things are depends on the range of the observer.
- Who you are determines how you see determines what you see.
- Our experience creates reality, it doesn't describe it.
- Direct experience of reality, not thought.
- Look for the gaps between perceptual objects.
- Reality is filtered through our (six) senses.
- Take the map less seriously.

## Interbeing

<div class="boxout" markdown="1">
- Subject and object arise a pair, as the contents of consciousness.
- Edges, boundaries, division, only exist in thought, not reality.
- Look for the edges. Look for the centre.
- See things on a spectrum, not a binary.
- Concepts are a grasp at reality, creating dualities. Grasping causes suffering.

</div>

- There are no straight lines in nature.
- Our life is a gift from everyone who came before.
- Everything exists in relation. There's distinction, but not division.
- Suffering and happiness are not separate.
- We inter-are at every level.
- We are nature, not separate from it, not in it.
- Look for the edges.
- Reality is one indivisible whole.
- We are deeply interdependent.
- Every thing is made up of not-that-thing elements.
- Our deepest nature is the unity that includes diversity.
- The oneness of the birds and the sky, the fish and the water, life and the Tao.
- The unity of the absolute and the relative.
- Layers, divisions, states, stages are creations not descriptions.
- No distinction between the knower, the knowing, the know.
- The knowing and the known arise as a pair, distinct but not separate.
- The interaction and superimposition of perception and thought creates dualities.
- Subject and objects aren't truly distinguishable.
- Notice how boundaries move when you try to fix them, grasp them.

## Reality vs concepts

<div class="boxout" markdown="1">
Use the map, but hold it lightly. Take in the richness and complexity of the territory.
</div>

- Reality is fractal.
- Reality is complex, deep, rich.
- Simplicity is a feature of our models, not of reality.
- All phenomena exist only in aggregate, by convention.
- Concepts put imaginary fences around things.
- Concepts are the map, not the territory.
- There's a lot going on there.
- Our mechanisms for simplifying reality prevent us from understanding it.
