(Or: What happens when I plug "stance" and some related words into a thesaurus)

**Stance.** I like stance because it implies a kind of active passivity. A ready and receptive state, but with direction and orientation. An inclination, but one that's open more than closed. It can also have a kind of implied physical, embodied, meaning. Like  "go with the flow, and steer it". Like redirecting a river a bit, not trying to dam it.

I've often using navigation heading or compass heading. Which I also like. But in the real world context that usually implies a destination, which I want to avoid. Wind direction is perhaps good. Wind certainly has force and direction (like a vector), but it doesn't "go somewhere".

Something like: Posture; Attitude; Disposition; Inclination; Orientation; Outlook.
