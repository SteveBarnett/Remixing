Notes from [5 Keys to Becoming a Meditation Teacher](https://mmtcp.soundstrue.com/5-keys/player-1/).

## 1. A Teacher's Guide to Self-Kindness

- What happened? What made you want to teach?
- Whatever the circumstances, trust you can awaken through them.
- Guide people to find that awareness.
- Your sense of aliveness and trust can be contagious.

## 2. Cultivating a Sanctuary for the Sacred

- The sufferings in the world come from the human heart.
- When you quiet your heart, you become a sanctuary for yourself and others.
- Be loving to yourself in the way you try to be loving to others.

## 3. Remember the Gold: Uncovering your inner Buddha

- We teach from the radiance of our own discovery.
- We cover ourselves, with our ego, to protect ourselves from injury.
    - But we identify with that, forget the gold.
- Help people to trust who they are.

## 4. Carry the Lamp of Awakening

- Even a little  bit of mindfulness is a powerful medicine.
- Teaching is a practice in itself.
    - It will have its way with you.

## 5. Serving as a conscious leader

- These practices shift our consciousness.
- This path has the capacity to give us a refuge that will carry us through.
