Gathering notes on aversion, giving [The Avoidance Alarm](/thinking/the-avoidance-alarm/) some cheeky side-eye.

Aversion, or anger, hatred, hostility.

I feel like I rationally understand the stuff I've gathered below. But I'm still not getting it in a more visceral and embodied sense. Mettā is a solid counter to aversion, but I really struggle with directing it at myself. Time to revisit [My mirror Metta](/thinking/my-mirror-metta/), methinks.

## Gathered highlights

- Aversion can be anger, resentment, bitterness
- It arises when when we take the impersonal personally
    - The thought of a thing is not the thing: it's just a thought
    - Fear is often lurking underneath aversion
- **It's a sign of "if only" mind**, that we're thinking the present moment is in some way flawed and inadequate
- The most common reaction to aversion is avoidance
    - **By avoiding we hope to avoid negative feelings, or make them go away, but it doesn't work**
    - **Unskillful behaviour can result in difficulties when pain can't be avoided**
- **Aversion is countered by**
    - lovingkindness / **mettā, including to ourselves**
    - noticing it without judgement, letting it be

### From Doubt And Aversion on The Path of Insight on Waking Up

Feelings are real but not true. The thought of a thing is not the thing: it's just a thought.

**Aversion arises when we take the impersonal personally.**

### [The Three Poisons And Their Antidotes](https://mindworks.org/blog/the-three-poisons-and-their-antidotes/)

Aversion

Aversion includes hatred, ill-will or anger, as well as less intense emotions based on aggression. This energy keeps us trapped in thinking we’d be happy **if only** this moment would change. It’s the energy that has us blaming the happiness of others for somehow taking from ours. But joy is not a limited commodity, there’s plenty of it to go around. **Joy is even available in our most challenging moments, if only we could see clearly.**

Ill-Will and Loving-Kindness

To overcome this poison of ill-will, hatred or aversion, we practice lovingkindness, the wish that all others experience joy. When another is happy, we can share in their good fortune by being happy for them. **Lovingkindness, when practiced genuinely, is applied to all beings equally, including ourselves.**

When facing unpleasant experiences, whether the source is internal or external, responding with compassion invites us to stop avoiding what we feel. Hatred and anger dissolve as we recognize our common humanity. We all want to be happy and free from our pain.

### [Aversion. The Flip Side of Craving](https://buddhistbasedcbt.com/2017/10/09/aversion-the-flip-side-of-craving/)

Aversion is a feeling we typically get when we think about something we have negative associations of, that is repulsive, or we find disgusting.  This feeling is usually followed by **the most common reaction to aversion – avoidance**.  Avoidance is a behavior we take in response to these negative thoughts and feelings we experience, **hoping by avoiding we can avoid the negative feeling, or make the negative feeling go away.**

Your **life** would **constrict and become smaller.**  You would lose a lot of the enjoyment that comes with living a full active life.  Small problems might suddenly become bigger because you aren’t dealing with them.

### [Aversion](https://mindfulnessmeditation.net.au/aversion/)

There is nothing wrong, of course, in trying to avoid pain and things which are unpleasant. The **difficulties can arise when we choose unskillful means of escaping pain, or when we find ourselves in a situation where pain can’t be avoided. Sometimes the ‘cure’ can become as problematic as the original difficulty** ...

**What we are really saying, when we’re avoiding/suppressing/escaping, is that the present moment is in some way flawed and inadequate.** Unfortunately, in the course of a day, this can add up to a lot of flawed and inadequate moments.

### [What Are The Three Poisons Of Buddhism?](https://www.zen-buddhism.net/what-are-the-three-poisons-of-buddhism/)

Anger, also known as hatred, refers to our negative feelings towards people, situations, or things that we find unpleasant or threatening. It can manifest as anger, **resentment**, **bitterness**, or prejudice towards individuals, groups, or circumstances that we find challenging or unpleasant.

Developing compassion: By cultivating **compassion and loving-kindness towards oneself and others**, one can overcome the poisons of anger and hatred. This can involve practicing meditation techniques such as loving-kindness meditation (metta) or engaging in acts of service or generosity towards others.

### [Five Hindrances II: Aversion](https://www.mnzencenter.org/tim-burketts-blog/five-hindrances-ii-aversion)


Whenever we have a strong negative feeling, can we **acknowledge that it has arisen and notice the strength of its energy**? Can we be aware of the feeling and touch it with our hearts? Can we **connect with it from a place of tenderness or caring**, making friends with it? If we can’t let things into our heart, we don’t really let ourselves grow. **Trying to get over our aversions or get rid of them simply doesn’t work.**

**Underlying aversion, fear is often lurking.**

We can narrow the focus, broaden the focus, or changing our focus in some other way.

**In other situations we find aversive, we might ask ourselves what we might learn from this.**

the fear that underlies aversion is always about something that hasn’t yet happened. In periods of short or longer meditation we have the luxury of time to **just be with fear as it comes up.**  **As we learn more and more about it without judging or evaluating it, its power naturally dissipates and even vanishes** ...
