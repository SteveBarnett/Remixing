- Both/and and either/or
- “The road up and the road down are the same thing”
- **Both arise at the same time**
- A thing and its opposite can both be true at the same time
- To have seen it from one side only is not to have seen it
- Mutually sustaining opposites, like magnetic poles or mountains and valleys
- Reconciliation and holding together of opposites
    - Not a midpoint or a collapsing of them
- **Linearity and circularity co-exist in a spiral**

## [Unity of opposites](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_of_opposites)

- The unity of opposites (coincidentia oppositorum or coniunctio) is the philosophical idea that opposites are interconnected by the way each is defined in relation to the other. Their interdependence unites the seemingly opposed terms.
- first suggested to the western view by Heraclitus
- There was, according to Anaximander, a continual war of opposites. 
- According to Anaximenes, there was not so much a war of opposites, as a continuum of change.
- The universe of Heraclitus is in constant change, while remaining the same. That is to say, when an object moves from point A to point B, a change is created, while the underlying law remains the same. Thus, a unity of opposites is present in the universe simultaneously containing difference and sameness. An aphorism of Heraclitus illustrates the idea as follows: "The road up and the road down are the same thing. (Hippolytus, Refutations 9.10.3)"
- Heraclitus also uses the succession of opposites as a basis for change
- The term is also used in describing a revelation of the oneness of things previously believed to be different. Such insight into the unity of things is a kind of immanence, and is found in various non-dualist and dualist traditions.
- opposites presuppose one another analytically
- they are opposites but they co-substantiate one another, their unity is that either one exists because the opposite is necessary for the existence of the other, one manifests immediately with the other

- If you don't accept both sides, you may end up with the opposite of what you wanted.
- to have seen it from one side only is not to have seen it
- Mutually sustaining opposites, like magnetic poles or mountains and valleys
- The whole truth is the reconciliation and holding together of opposites, not a midpoint or a collapsing of them

## [The Matter With Things – the coincidence of opposites](https://stevebarnett.me/notes/the-matter-with-things/the%20coindidence%20of%20opposites.jpg)

- A bar magnet's opposites are part of a larger whole. Even when halved!
- Heraticlus's taught string: the tension of opposites is energetic, creative

## [TMWT Chapter 20](https://stevebarnett.me/notes/the-matter-with-things/tmwt%20v2%20pt%203%20ch20%20-%20the%20coincidentia%20oppositorum.jpg)

- We need the harmony of difference and sameness, the non-duality of non-duality and duality

## [The Coincidence of Opposites. A talk by Iain McGilchrist](https://jennymackness.wordpress.com/2021/11/27/the-coincidence-of-opposites-a-talk-by-iain-mcgilchrist/)

- the word ‘coincide’ in this chapter, ‘… means more than that opposites happen to look like one another, even to cohere, to concur, or to be in accord, though those meanings are present, too: it means that they ‘fall together’, like the superposition of the two images which, when projected on a screen, overlap precisely to form a new image.’ (p.821, TMWT)
- ‘A thing without oppositions ipso facto does not exist … existence lies in opposition.’
- 'Energy is always characterised by the coming together of apparent opposites …’ (p.816, TMWT)
- Opposites do not have a linear irreconcilable relationship; it is not the case that the further you go towards one end of the line the further away you are from the opposite end. Rather, opposites eventually tend to coincide.
- ‘A principle that is extended too far, without respect to the opposite that is always inherent in it, may turn into the very thing that is not only undesired, but is being denied.’ (p.829, TMWT). If you go far enough in any direction you reach not more of what you desired but its opposite.
- Linearity and circularity co-exist in a spiral.
- A thing and its opposite can both be true at the same time.
- Jacob Needleman (2016) wrote: ‘Stay with the contradiction. If you stay you will see that there is always something more than two opposing truths. The whole truth always includes a third part, which is the reconciliation.’ East and West are simultaneously present on a compass and need to be so, not just to navigate the world, but to have a world to navigate.
-  The whole is never an annihilation but rather a subsumption of the parts. All is one, but also all is many. Both are true. As Goethe (1948) noted, we need the union of union and division.
- The two hemispheres of the brain work together by being apart (separated by the corpus callosum). They cooperate by opposing one another. They inhibit and inform one another, at times standing back and away from one another, and also at times working in unison. Their relationship is oppositional, but not contradictory. ... But whilst the two hemispheres are equally necessary and need to work together, they are unequal in status.
- The drive of the cosmos is about distinction without separation.
- There is an asymmetry at the heart of the coincidentia oppositorum. Union and division are asymmetrical. The principle for division and the principle for union need to be brought together, not divided ( p.833, TMWT). We need the union of union and division, not the division of union and division.
- We need not either both/and or either/or, but both both/and and either/or.
