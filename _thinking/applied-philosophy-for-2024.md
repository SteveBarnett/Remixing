I tend to be a very practical person. Although I love analysis and thinking and figuring things out, it usually comes down "and now what?" Below are practices that help me bring to mind elements of [my philosophy](/thinking/my-philosophy/).

[My theme for 2024 is rest](/thinking/themes-for-2024/) so the practices are framed by that.

Something like: let go, relax, rest, melt, widen, loosen, accept, wait.

- Reality is one indivisible whole. **Let go of the divisions. Rest in the wider, more inclusive, view.**
- Reality is flow, motion, process. **Rest and watch for the changes.**
	- Resistance to the flow is what brings complexity, forms.**Relax and watch the swirls and twirls of the flow.**
- Reality is complex, deep, rich. **Stop the work of simplifying and classifying and boxing up.**
- Perception is participation. **Loosen your grip on your view.**
- Concepts are a map, not the territory. **Take the map less seriously, less precisely.**
- Our true nature is the context of consciousness, not the contents. **Take the backward step, rest as that which is aware.**
- The self is causes, conditions, patterns. **Put down the patterns. Let go of who you think you should be. Look for yourself at zero distance.**
- This truth is simple, close, immediate. **Rest, and stop trying (so hard).**
