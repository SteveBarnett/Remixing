Now lives at [MAP](/thinking/map/).

I tend to be a very practical person. Although I love analysis and thinking and figuring things out, it usually comes down "and now what?" Below are practices that help me bring to mind elements of [my (updated) philosophy](/thinking/my-philosophy-another-spiral/).

[My theme for 2024 is rest](/thinking/themes-for-2024/) so the practices are framed by that. Something like: let go, relax, rest, melt, widen, loosen, accept, wait. Rest, and stop pushing so hard.

- The cosmos is purposeful but/and playful.
	- **Notice the playful patterns and variations of everything.**
- Your true nature is the context of consciousness, not the contents.
	- **Relax into direct, embodied, experience.**
- Subject and object arise as a pair in awareness.
	- **Notice the causes, conditions, and patterns that form your sense of self.**
- Liberation is seeing through the illusion of there being a problem.
	- **Let go of the stories: the need to solve the problem; the problem itself; the self.**
- Reality is one indivisible whole.
	- **Put down the work of dividing and labelling.**
- Reality is flow, motion, change.
	- **Watch things arise, then pass away.**
- Reality is complex, deep, rich.
	- **Hold the map more loosely.**
- Reality is the source of all our thoughts and actions.
	- **Take things less personally.**
- Perception is participation, and creates different forms, depending on the scale.
