From [Nondual Spirituality? by Joan Tollifson](https://joantollifson.substack.com/p/nondual-spirituality-9e9)

## Gathered notes

- Everything is sacred
- Just this, exactly as it is
    - It couldn't be any other way
- Wake up from thought-induced suffering and confusion
    - Stop conflating abstract conceptual maps for experiential living reality
    - Notice the love, the joy, the wholeness of life right here in each ordinary moment

## Raw highlights

- everything is sacred
- simply being alive is enough
- the perfect path is exactly the one you are on
- nothing could be other than it is in this moment
- it's possible in any moment to wake up from thought-induced suffering and find the joy in life as it is
- The awakening journey, as I see it, is about finding the love, the beauty, the joy, the wonder, the wholeness of life right here in each ordinary moment. It's about seeing how we create needless suffering and confusion by the ways we think about and resist what shows up, and by the ways we live mostly in our thoughts, mistaking abstract conceptual maps for the experiential living actuality without even realizing that this is happening.
- Unconditional love is the nature of awareness—it has space for everything, it allows everything to be as it is, it clings to nothing, it sees from wholeness.
- Consciousness gets lost in the delusion of separation and duality, identifying as a small, limited, encapsulated self, feeling deficient and incomplete, endlessly seeking and resisting, perpetually in conflict with the seemingly outside world of not-me, trying to control the uncontrollable and in despair and anxiety when it can’t.
- this aliveness, this presence, this immediacy—just this, exactly as it is.
