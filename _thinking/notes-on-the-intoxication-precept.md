- A precept is a tool for liberation, not a way to measure our own (or other's) worth.
    - When we beat ourselves up for finding things we don't like, we quickly stop seeing those things.
- Precepts can can be phrased as a prohibition or an aspiration. Sometimes one phrasing will be more useful than the other. 
    - Abstain from intoxication, from addictive or compulsive behaviour.
    - Cultivate a clear mind, bring compassionate awareness to whatever's arising.
- Just observe and understand our patterns of thinking and behaving. 
    - Do they lead towards awareness or towards suffering?
- Notice the beliefs and and stories underneath the patterns.
    - That something is wrong
    - That things should be different.
- Give everything a warm welcome.
    - Nothing needs to be different from how it is.
    - Nothing can be different from how it is.
- Here, centred in the moment, there are no problems.
    - When you realise you're identical to experience, there is no suffering.
    - When you believe you're separate, there is suffering.

A precept can be a beacon, a lighthouse, a tool for liberation. It can help us:
- notice reactivity;
- highlight our habitual patterns of thinking;
- squarely face the consequences of our actions;
- remember to Begin Again;
- realise our shared, flawed, humanity.

It is **not** for measuring our own or others' worth. "Am I able to be in the present moment?", not "Am I a good person or a bad person?"

## Phrasings of the intoxication precept

### As prohibition

To provide boundaries.

- Abstain from intoxication.
- Refrain from intoxicants, and addictive or compulsive behaviour.
- Not indulging in intoxicants.

### As aspiration

- Proceed clearly.
- Do not cloud the mind.
- I take up the way of cultivating a clear mind.
- Awareness, not clouding.
- We don't want to cloud our minds in any way that takes us away from the immediate perception of the moment.
- Bring compassionate awareness to everything you're doing.

### The why, not the what, of substances

- It's not the substance, but if we use it to alter or escape experience. 
- It's to numb the pain or leave an experience.
- It's not the intoxicant itself but our own process of addiction, of using the substance to maintain an identity that keeps us out of the present moment
- Drinking and using drugs is another way of looking elsewhere or wanting things to be different, based on the assumption that there's something wrong with what's happening

### More widely

- Embracing all experience directly.
- Live fully present to life.
- Not hiding from the truth.
- When we learn to let go and relax into the moment, then our interest in being right, safe, and under control begins to fall away.

The accompanying values: mindfulness, responsibility.

## Working with precepts

Pick one precept to work with for a while. Pick one circumstance to work with.

### The details

- Just sit for a few minutes, at first.
- Be awake to the motivation and consequences of our actions.
- Observe our behaviour.
- Understand our patterns.
- Uncover the beliefs underneath (which come from our culture, our upbringing, our natural tendencies);
    - Notice the requirements we place on yourself and others.
    - Notice if you find yourself glued to a notion that something has to be a certain way.
    - Notice where we draw the line about what's acceptable and not acceptable.
- Make it into an experiment, get to know ourself.
- Look at the intention behind the act
    - Does it lead towards awareness or away from it?
    - Towards suffering or away from it?

Often we give up the substance without addressing the causes. That can be just one more act of cruelty.

## Wider view on the precepts

Our reactions to ordinary, everyday, events show us our true colours. Use them to wake up.

- Take the precepts as a whole.
- They interact with and support each other.
- Treat them as guidelines, not rules.
