I'm not a big boozer or drugger, but the "Abstaining from intoxicants" seems to have a lot of crossover with running away, or avoiding. And I a pretty big avoider. In particular, I tend to have an avoidant attachment style.

- The precept: Abstain from intoxication. The accompanying values: mindfulness, responsibility.
- Refrain from intoxicants, and addictive or compulsive behaviour. (From [my notes from tricycle](/notes/buddhism/tricyle - the five precepts.jpg))
- Proceed clearly / Do not cloud the mind. (From [my notes on The Sixteen Bodhisattva Precepts of Sōtō Zen](/notes/zen/the sixteen bodhisattva precepts in soto zen.jpg))
- (Do what best serves life.) I take up the way of cultivating a clear mind (aka "Not indulging in intoxicants"). (From [my notes on Waking Up To What You Do](/notes/zen/waking up to what you do - precepts.jpg))
    - It's not the substance, but how we use it. To alter or escape experience. 
        - Just sit for a few minutes, at first.

Take the precepts as a whole. They interact with and support each other. Treat them as guidelines, not rules.

Pick one precept to work with for a while. Pick one circumstance to work with.

Precepts as prohibition provide boundaries. Precepts as aspiration point toward learning by doing, self-motivation.

- Observe your behaviour.
- Understand your patterns.
- Uncover the beliefs underneath, the requirements you're placing on yourself and others.
    - From our culture, upbringing, natural tendencies.

Be awake to the motivation and consequences of our actions.

Our reactions to ordinary, everyday, events show us our true colours. Use them to wake up.

- A Precept can be a beacon, a lighthouse, a tool for liberation, for noticing reactivity.
    - for seeing our habitual patterns of thinking
        - for squarely facing the consequences of our actions
        - as a reminder to Begin Again
        - **not** for measuring our own or others' worth, but of realising our shared, flawed, humanity.

My notes from Good Life: A Zen Precepts Retreat with Cheri Huber.

- Awareness, Not clouding, embracing all experience directly.
- There's no need to hide from the truth.
- Drinking and using drugs is another way of looking elsewhere or wanting things to be different
    - based on the assumption that there's something wrong with what's happening
- It's to numb the pain or leave an experience
- It's not the intoxicant itself but our own process of addiction
    - of using the substance to maintain an identity that keeps us out of the present moment
- Look at the intention behind the act
    - Does it lead towards awareness or away from it?
    - Towards suffering or away from it?
- We don't want to cloud our minds in any way that takes us away from the immediate perception of the moment.
- Notice if you find yourself glued to a notion that something has to be a certain way
- Bring compassionate awareness to everything you're doing
- Live fully present to life
- When we learn to let go and relax into the moment, then your interest in being right, safe, and under control begins to fall away
- "Am I able to be in the present moment?", not "Am I a good person or a bad person?"
- Often we give up the substance without addressing the causes. That can be just one more act of cruelty.
- Notice what we can learn from noticing where we draw the line about what's not acceptable.
- Make it into an experiment, get to know yourself.
