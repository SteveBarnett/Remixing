<p>I heard a turn of phrase the other day that I like:

<blockquote><p>"Is this <strong>fruitful</strong>?"</p></blockquote>

<p>As opposed to helpful. In particular, as opposed to useful.</p>

<p>I tend to be more interested in whether something is helpful more than whether it's true. I sometimes slip into saying "useful." That ends up feeling uncomfortable, and I realise I meant helpful. Useful means it's more like a tool. But helpful means it's more like a strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Fruitful</strong> feels like it hits a sweet spot here. Practice is helpful, but it's not useful (in the sense that it's not a tool). Practice can't be reduced to it usefulness, but... it does get results. Regular, sustained, practice is definitely <strong>fruitful</strong>.</p>
