Things that I'm thinking about:

- **Social Media as a foreshadowing** for what's to come with AI. The Social Dilemma becomes the AI Dilemma. The Attention Economy becomes The Intimacy Economy.
- **Bias.** 
	- LLMs, algorithms, can't be biased because humans are involved at some point and we are biased. Humans are involved in choosing the training data, refining the model, using the output, interpreting the output.
	- Data represents the past, including our mistakes. In particular, systemic bias.
	- The data implies what's Average or Normal. But that's reducing the complexity of human existence. Sometimes we want the outliers, the more creative options.
	- The training data to output to training data feedback loop.
- **Opaque.** We donâ€™t know why: who got the job, the loan, the medical treatment, the prison sentence?
- **Regulation.** Preventing harm, including things we have thought of yet.
- **Confabulation.** AI's are great at Confident Bullshitting. They make things up, but present it as fact.
- **Quality**. AI is good at quantity-related things, but bad at quality-related things.

I'm keeping some notes in [my Ethics and Tech section](/notes/ethics-in-tech/).
