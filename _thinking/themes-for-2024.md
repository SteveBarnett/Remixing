Off the back of [a review of the year](/thinking/2023-year-in-review/), and some thinking about [my bigger picture philosophy](/thinking/my-philosophy/), I scribbled a big buncha notes.

## Practice

My theme for 2024 is going to (try and) be:

> Rest a bit more, rejoice a bit more.

Or maybe

> "I well get more rest, be more at rest, and leave the rest aside."

- Resting and relaxing is something I have not been doing very well during 2023.
	- Some things that I find relaxing: meditating, cooking, sketching, walking, arting, reading, music(k?)ing.
- I have a tendency to forwards momentum, which means I sometimes forget or gloss over celebrating good things.

## Philosophy

I keep finding myself being drawn back to **Zen** and **Daoism**. I'm going to dig more deeply into those this year, leaning more towards those than psychology or philosophy or nonduality or Buddhism more broadly.
