- **What is** has value. **What is not** has use.
- Form is valuable. (But/and) emptiness is useful.

## Interpretations of the two sides, collaged

- What is / form / being for gain / advantage / value.
- What is not / emptiness / non-being for usefulness.

## The two sides

- what is / the tangible / Something / what is / being / what is / form
    - profit / advantages / gain / create / work with / valuable / clever
- what isn’t / intangible / Nothing / what is not / non-being / what is not / emptiness
    - use / useful / put to use / use / what we use / useful / useful

## Final lines of the chapter

So the profit in what is<br>
is in the use of what isn’t.

Thus, while the tangible has advantages,<br>
It is the intangible that makes it useful.

Thus what we gain is Something, yet it is by virtue of Nothing that this can be put to use.

Thus do we<br>
create what is<br>
to use what is not.

We work with being,<br>
but non-being is what we use.

What is valuable comes from what is; what is useful comes from what is not.

Therefore form is employed<br>
In order to make things clever;<br>
Emptiness is employed<br>
In order to make them useful.

## From my favourite edition, Ursula K. Le Guin's

**11. The Uses of Not**

Thirty spokes<br>
meet in the hub.<br>
Where the wheel isn’t<br>
is where it’s useful.<br>

Hollowed out,<br>
clay makes a pot.<br>
Where the pot’s not<br>
is where it’s useful.

Cut doors and windows<br>
to make a room.<br>
Where the room isn’t,<br>
there’s room for you.

**So the profit in what is<br>
is in the use of what isn’t.**


## From other editions I have read

### John C. H. Wu

We make a vessel from a lump of clay<br>
It is the empty space within the vessel that makes it useful.

**Thus, while the tangible has advantages,<br>
It is the intangible that makes it useful.**

### D. C. Lau

Knead clay in order to make a vessel. Adapt the nothing therein to the purpose in hand, and you will have the use of the vessel. ... **Thus what we gain is Something, yet it is by virtue of Nothing that this can be put to use.**

### Arthur Waley

We turn clay to make a vessel;<br>
But it is on the space where there is nothing that the usefulness of the vessel depends.

**Therefore just as we take advantage of what is, we should recognise the usefulness of what is not.**

## Ralph Alan Dale

We shape clay<br>
to birth a vessel,<br>
yet it's the hollow within<br>
that makes it useful.

**Thus do we<br>
create what is<br>
to use what is not.**

## From other editions I haven't read yet

### Stephen Mitchell

We shape clay into a pot,<br>
but it is the emptiness inside<br>
that holds whatever we want.

...

We work with being,<br>
but non-being is what we use.

## John Patterson

When clay is formed into a pot<br>
the place left empty<br>
makes the pot useful.

...

Yes, what we have may be profitable,<br>
But – what we do not have;<br>
that is also useful.

## Ray Grigg

A vessel is shaped from clay but its usefulness comes from the empty space within.

**What is valuable comes from what is; what is useful comes from what is not.**

## Benjamin Hoff

Shape clay into a form.<br>
In order to make a vessel.<br>
In its emptiness–<br>
The cavity inside of it–<br>
Can be found the vessel's<br>
Usefulness.

**Therefore form is employed<br>
In order to make things clever;<br>
Emptiness is employed<br>
In order to make them useful.**
