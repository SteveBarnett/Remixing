**What's on top?** Your name, and what's top of mind for you.

## Introduction

- This session **more practical and less theory.** Perhaps **a bit odd.**
- I have a **handful of questions** for us to meditate on. Interesting inquiries, peculiar prompts, weird wonderings, curious cues.
    - The questions we'll consider, contemplate, and check out invite us to look **more from an experiential angle than a conceptual one.**
    - Concepts are useful, but they simplify and exclude, make things fixed and static.
    - Experiential answers can be more wide and meaningful and interesting.
- I've gathered them from a bunch of **different teachers.** I'll say a tiny stats and vibe check about them with the question.

### Why these questions?

- To the **see the truth.** The questions are pointers or guide or invitations to see something that's usually, frequently, obscured.
    - To use a classic analogy: the sun is always there and shining, but sometimes behind clouds, or a storm, or its night-time.
- To **find some peace.** Find a bit more space. Make space around difficult or uncomfortable thoughts and feelings.

### Structure

1. I'll **introduce the questions,** and where I've most recently seen it.
2. We'll do a **short 5 minute meditation on it**.
    - I'll ring the bell once to start the little sit, and ring it once to end it.
3. We'll see if we want to have a **short discussion** about it.
4. We'll move on to another questions. We'll do as many questions as we do.
5. We'll **close with our usual 20 minute silent sit.**

### Example: singing bowl.

What is this?

- Lots of possible answers. Use, shape, colour, size, meaning. But they all miss something.
- Here's a complete answer: **[sings the bowl]**. The verb is the answer. (Seung Sahn)
    - Stats: Korean Zen Master, 1927–2004.
    - Vibe check: letters to students and "dharma combat".
- Can you taste the difference a bit? Between the labels and the verb?
- In my experience, the more we think about it, the more confusing it gets. The less we think, the more it "makes sense."

## Questions

**Where do your thoughts come from? Where do they go? (Tara Brach)**

- Stats: Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology, trained Buddhist teacher. Hundreds of articles, videos, talks, and some great books.
