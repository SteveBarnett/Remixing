**What's on top?** Your name, and what's top of mind for you.

## Introduction

- This session **more practical and less theory.** Perhaps **a bit odd.**

### Topic

I have a **handful of questions.** Interesting inquiries, peculiar prompts, weird wonderings, curious cues.

- I've gathered them from a bunch of **different teachers.** I'll say a tiny stats and vibe check about them with the question. Please feel free to correct things I got wrong!
- They all do something similar: they're pointers or guides or invitations to explore a bit more about **who you really are.** Some traditions say "**your true nature.**"
- The questions we'll consider, contemplate, and check out invite us to look **more from an experiential angle than a conceptual one.**
    - Concepts are useful, but they create division, simplify and exclude, make things fixed and static.
    - Experiential answers can be more wide and meaningful and interesting.

### Example: singing bowl.

What is this?

- Lots of possible answers. Use, shape, colour, size, meaning. But they all miss something.
- Here's a complete answer: **[sings the bowl]**. The verb is the answer. (Seung Sahn)
    - Stats: Korean Zen Master, 1927–2004.
    - Vibe check: letters to students and "dharma combat".
- Can you taste the difference a bit? Between the labels and the verb?
- In my experience, the more we think about it, the more confusing it gets. The less we think, the more it "makes sense."
- Another good answer is "I don't know." Lots going on there, but: realising that any word-y answer can't capture it. And that just experiencing it is very "close." (Dizang)
    - Stats: Zen Master. Lived about 1,100 years ago.
    - Vibe check: “Not knowing is most intimate.” in a koan.

### Why these questions?

There a couple of takes.

- To the **see the truth.** See something that's usually, frequently, obscured.
    - To use a classic analogy: the sun is always there and shining, but sometimes behind clouds, or a storm, or its night-time.
- To **find some peace.** Find a bit more space. Make space around difficult or uncomfortable thoughts and feelings.

### Structure

I'll **introduce the questions,** and where I've most recently seen it. Then we'll do a **short meditation on it**, followed by a **short discussion.**

<!--
For the sitting:

- Not **what you know.** What you experience, before labelling it or judging it.
- Not **what it means.** Just what is is, just what is given.
- Not **what others say.** What you find when you check for yourself.
 -->
We'll do as many questions as we do.

We'll **close with our usual 20 minute silent sit.**
