- **What's on top?** Your name, and what's top of mind for you.
- This will be perhaps a bit different to other sessions.
    - It‚Äôs going to be more **practical, and less theory.**
- Topic: I have a **handful of questions.** Interesting inquiries, peculiar prompts, weird wonderings, curious cues.
    - I've gathered them from a bunch of different sources and teachers.
    - They all do something similar: they're pointers or guides or invitations to explore a bit more about **who you really are.**
    - Of course, **there are some quick and easy answers to "Who am I?"** (and related questions).
    - But the questions we'll consider, contemplate, and check out invite us to **look a bit more deeply.**
    - And, importantly, **more from an experiential angle than a conceptual one.**
    - Conceptual answers can be fuzzy if you keep digging but/and limiting and constraining.
    - Experiential answers can be more meaningful and interesting.
    - If you're familiar with Zen koans, they're a bit like that. Not a riddle solve, but a question to sit with.
- Example: this singing bowl.
    - Is this a singing bowl or not?
    - If you say yes, you are attached to name and form.
    - If you say no, you are attached to emptiness.
    - **Singing the bowl is a complete answer.**
    - The verb, the action.
- Structure: I'll **introduce the questions,** and where I've most recently seen it. Then we'll do a **short meditation on it**, followed by a **short discussion.** For the sitting:
    - Not **what you know.** What you experience, before labelling it or judging it.
    - Not **what it means.** Just what is is, just what is given.
    - Not **what others say.** What you find when you check for yourself.
- We'll do as many questions as we do.
- We'll **close with a longer, silent, sit.**

## Meetup

Title: Answerable and unanswerable questions (or: A different kind of Quiz Night)

Blurb: ‚ùì In this session, we'll be contemplating a few questions designed to point to our true nature, approaching things from a more experiential, less conceptual, angle. A bit like a Quiz Night, but with questions more like "Who am I?" and less like "What year was Buddha born?" 

üßò We'll do a short meditation on each question, followed by a short discussion. We'll close with a longer, silent, sit.
