While writing up [Self-acceptance practices](/thinking/self-acceptance-practices/) I think I (re?)tripped over a way to make parts of metta practice work a bit better for me. And maybe another angle on [some of the critic bits](#some-of-the-critic-bits) ðŸ‘‡.

What I noticed was...

- I find it easy to direct metta outwards, even for "difficult" people.
- I find it very difficult to direct metta inwards, at myself.
- I find it powerful when I imagine someone directing metta at me.
- I find it very powerful when it's a mirror of something I find easy to give someone else, and/or something that's important to me and aligns with my values.

So the "trick" here, to sort of fool myself into being kind to myself, to avoid or shut up The Critic, is to

<div class="boxout">mirror the metta.</div>

When I'm struggling with something:

- be clear on what I'm struggling with;
- direct metta at someone who's struggling with something similar;
- imagine them reflecting, directing that same metta back at me.
