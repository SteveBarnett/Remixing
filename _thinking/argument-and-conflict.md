<!--
Some ideas:

- Qualities of a good argument / arguer.
- Questions to ask.
- An agenda.

Present your case, showing the chain of reasoning.
-->

Be clear on what assumptions we're making, and how we have or will test them.

- Talk through an impact map.
	- It reveals the assumptions, including hidden and implicit ones.
	- It shows the connections.
	- Talk to how we have or will test these assumptions.
- Ask them to talk through an impact map.
	- Say when you don't understand, but you want to.
	- Get underneath. Bring out the underlying values, needs, fears.
	- Be kind, respectful, patient. Make the most generous, respectful, interpretation.
- Ask questions.
	- What's your point?
	- What do you mean?
	- What are you worried will happen (or not happen)?
- Evaluate claims.
	- Data, plausibility, practicality, history.
	- What's the actual, not perceived risk? Likelihood x Impact.
	- What's your confidence level?

## Impact map reminder

- Goal: **Why** are we doing this?
- Actor: **Who**'s behaviour do we want to change?
- Impact: **How** do we want their behaviour to change?
- Deliverable: **What** will we do to make that happen?
- Measurable: How will be **check** it?

<!-- 
## Affinitising the tops

- The three conversations: what happened, feelings, identity.

- Map out the argument.
	- Make your assumptions explicit.

- Be open, admit your ignorance
- Admit ignorance, give power.

- Give love, support, sympathy to those who need it, not those who "deserve" it.
- Make the most generous, respectful, interpretation.

- Be patient, keep at it.
- Don't interrupt others. If you're interrupted, point it out.

- "You are partly right."
- Find the common ground.

- Practice active listening: repeat, summarised in your own words, to check your understanding.

- Bring out and work with fears.
- Bring out the underlying values and needs.

- "What's your point?" steers towards a tell.
- Be more clear, keep ask for clarifying, asking if you are clear.
- "What do you mean?"
- Improve your understanding.

- Evaluate claims. Data, plausibility, practicality, history.
- Find the inconsistency. Find the counter-example. Find a wider context.
- What's the actual, not perceived risk? Likelihood x Impact.
- What's your confidence level?
- Let them trip over the truth.

- "Is this helpful?" rather than "is this a final, fundamental, truth?"
- When you oppose and don't understand: "how did we get here?"

## Raw notes
