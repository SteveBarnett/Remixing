- Rituals are more important than objectives
- Mythology, folk tales, and scared texts contain important truths and moral lessons
- Sacred places tend to be designed for us to feel transition or transformation

- In Shinto architecture, and Japanese culture in general, the emphasis tends to be placed on the traditions, methods, and ways of constructing or creating a work of art. [Compared to conservation, trying to alter as little as possible, allowing the appearance to decline over time]
- Japanese culture is very sensitive to the “context.” We have to change and adapt our behaviour to the situation we are in
- The Three Vinegar Tasters
    - Confucianism: sour expression
    - Buddhism: bitter expression

## From the book

### Chapter 0

- It's impossible to make explicit and clear that which is fundamentally by its very nature vague
- Emphasis on putting the practice of rituals ahead of beliefs
- Rituals are more important than objectives. There mere act of carrying out a ritual helps us more than achieving an objective does.
- "You are a function of what the whole universe is doing in the same way that a wave is a function of what the whole ocean is doing"
- Mythology, folk tales and scared texts contain many truths and moral lessons that are ... pragmatic and applicable to our lives
    - We don't calculate use Newton's equations before sitting on a chair, we simple hold the "belief" that the chair is not going to break

### Chapter 1: Time Travellers

- Animism is the belief that objects, natural elements, places and creatures have a spiritual essence
- <span lang="jp">Torii</span> gates are sacred thresholds. They mark out the dividing line between the sacred world and the profane world.
- Sacred places tend to be designed for us to feel transition or transformation
- <span lang="jp">mono no aware</span> – the pang of melancholy when realising that nothing is permanent
- A shrine, a temple, a synagogue, a mosque, are all works of art that contain human wisdom and tradition
- What activities, people, places or values, help you integrate the past, the present, and the future in one connecting thread?

### Chapter 4: The Shinto Shrine

- In Shinto architecture, and Japanese culture in general, the emphasis tends to be placed on the traditions, methods, and ways of constructing or creating a work of art. [Compared to conservation, trying to alter as little as possible, allowing the appearance to decline over time]
- One style: <span lang="jp">Nagare-zukuri</span>: flow-construction

### Chapter 5: Rituals, Festivals, and Ceremonies

- Japanese culture is very sensitive to the "context." We have to change and adapt our behaviour to the situation we are in, understanding that there are a series of implicit social norms or rules that are not apparent at first sight.
    - [I agree with context-sensitivity, but not necessarily with following the norms]
- In Japanese, instead of "sin" they use the words <span lang="jp">tsumi</span> (violation of rules) or <span lang="jp">kegare</span> (dishonour, defilement, corruption)

### Chapter 6: Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism

- The Three Vinegar Tasters
    - Confucianism: sour expression
    - Buddhism: bitter expression
    - Taoism: happy expression
- Confucianism's five most important virtues: benevolence, justice, ritualism, wisdom, integrity
- Wu wei: the best strategy is usually to follow the most natural course of action, the one requiring the least effort to resolve a tricky situation

### Chapter 7: Morality and Philosophy

- We tend to think our mission is to protect the forests. The Japanese version says it's also important for the forest and other creatures to protect us. It's a reciprocal, symbiotic, relationship.
- Integration and symbiosis on natural and artificial things (compared to Western separation)
- Harmony with natural environment and creating an atmosphere of peace (compared to Western trying to impress)
- Wakeiseijaku: wa harmony; kei respect; sei purity; jaku tranquility

### Chapter 8: Shinto-Inspired Practices for Everyday Life

- Adding space. Empty space is important in its own right.
- Reconnect with the rhythm of nature
- Use your intuition to make decisions
- Treat your home like a shrine
