- Balance as the dynamic process of alternating between two asymmetrical states.
    - Like a pendulum swinging back and forth.
    - Like the tide. Like the breath.

## Asymmetry

- There is an asymmetry at the heart of the coincidentia oppositorum. Union and division are asymmetrical. The principle for division and the principle for union need to be brought together, not divided ( p.833, TMWT). We need the union of union and division, not the division of union and division.
- Our human tendencies and the asymmetrical nature of the poles work to make one side "win"
- Things manifest as opposites, usually asymmetrical.
- For example: asymmetry is more important than symmetry because it can contain symmetry.
- If you really want to bake your noodle, you could consider that we usually need nonduality and duality, but in an asymmetric way. Subject and object are distinct, but not separate. But we’ll keep things practical in this session. Experiments to see who you really are, from your subjective point of view.
- Deliberately embracing imperfection and asymmetry
- Time, space, and matter are a magnificent succession of broken symmetries from The Big Bang
- Navigating life is about proportion and balance
- (And how this relates to flow and motion)
- Order gives strength, disorder gives flexibility
- Many processes in nature work imperfectly towards symmetry
- Maximal transparency is the most effective policy for removing informational  asymmetry
- Asymmetry encompasses symmetry
- Symmetry as operation leaves things unchanged. But life is change, creativity is change.

## Balance

- The ideal balance for self-compassion practice is to feel challenged but to explore just a bit beyond your comfort zone.
- “Practising to get better” and “practising because it’s how we want to be” balance each other excesses out.
- The trick is to keep at it, keeping your balance more often, for longer.
- Extreme tension-in-doubt. Great faith and great doubt kept in dynamic equilibrium balanced by great determination.
- Settle into an energetic balance, “between” two poles / opposites.
- The truth is that life is always a balance of light and dark, but because of the negativity bias of burnout, the light often gets relegated to the shadows.
- See the balanced view of yourself: your patterns and human imperfections; your basic innate goodness.
- Both sides of the gestalt are important in some way. The totality relies on a balance that includes both
- We're trying to balance elements of calmness and brightness.
- In Buddhism, impermanence is often referred to as the “Law of Change and Becoming”
    - These two correlated principles provide balance and harmony
    - Just as there is constant “dissolving,” there is also constant “becoming"
- Impermance. Reality is in constant motion. Things change.
    - This creates dukkha, suffering, dissatisfaction, uneasiness. We move to rebalance, restabilising, settle.
- Although there are many processes (like osmosis or homeostasis) that tend to balance and stability, they never stay there. There is no animal that is never hungry, or never sleepy.
- Harmonise and integrate and balance the polarities.
