- Why can't it be both?
    - It can!
    - Conceptual thought tends to object, but experience accepts.
- Paradox and craving and suffering.
    - Getting what you want, but being sad about it.

## Notes from other pages

- We don't believe we can have happiness and sadness at the same time. It seems like a paradox.
- The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change. —Carl Rogers
- Not either/or, but both/and. It seems a bit paradoxical. but only if we overthink it.   
- - the great paradox is that the path isn’t going somewhere else—it’s waking up to here and now, where we always already are—and the one who seems to be on the path is a movement of the whole, not a separate, autonomous entity
- It may seem that there is a paradox here: on the one hand, the Zen masters tell us to breathe and accept the situation; on the other, they say we must seek to change it. The way out is to do both.
- Zen uses contradiction and paradox to loosen our grip on concepts.
