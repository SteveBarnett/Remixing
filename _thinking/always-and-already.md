- **The contents of consciousness, the third-person objective view, are arising and falling away on their own.**
- **The clarity and stillness of the context of consciousness, the first-person subjective view, is always and already here and now.**
    - Not "Find and rest in the View", but "Realise there is only the View."
    - Bright, luminous, open.
    - Too close, too accessible, too present, and too simple.
    - Movement and thought occurs in the content, not the context.
        - **Including seeking.**
        - **Including "I've got it!"**
        - **Including "I'm not getting it!"**
    - **Just leave everything in its place.**
- Everything is included (in Reality). The context. The contents, including seeking.
    - **We are not doing in the world. The world is doing us, like it does trees, clouds.**
- The noticing of and from the context can, might, affect the contents.
- The play and dance of the contents doesn't affect the context.

## Gathered notes

- Always and already here.
    - The clarity and stillness of the context of consciousness, the first-person subjective view, is always and already here.
    - Always and already here, but temporarily concealed.
    - The contents of consciousness, of the third-person objective view, are arising and falling away on their own.
- Close, on the surface, easy, obvious.
    - Looking for it means overlooking it.
    - Like looking for things that weren't really lost, like glasses on your head or keys on the table.
    - Like making a tightly clenched fist that hurts your hard.
- Progress is an illusion.
    - "I'm not getting it" is the same as "I've got it!" 
    - Measuring progress is a great way to avoid being present here and now.
    - "This isn't it" is just a thought. A seductive, hypnotic, one! But just a thought. Notice that.
- Give up, let go, rest.
    - Just leave everything in its place.
    - Give up the fight. Put it down. Leave it there.

## Scribbled notes

(With bits from some recent Henry Shukman and Joan Tollifson posts)

- Other things that have that dis-covered-ness
    - The sun behind the clouds
    - A dirty mirror
    - **Looking for things that weren't really lost, like glasses on your head or keys on the table**
    - Closing the curtains during the daytime
    - Closing your eyes, but the world is still there
    - **Making a tightly clenched fist that hurts your hard**
    - Rough ocean surface, but underneath it's calm

### When there's a problem

1. Is it really a problem? What happens when you stop framing it as a problem?
2. Stop doing the thing that's making the problem.

### Peace

- Long-term peace doesn't come from fixing the problem, eliminating the problem. More problems come soon enough.
- Deeper peace is always and already here.
- It's not having a problem with the endless stream of problems.

- It's not about doing more, it's about doing less, about stopping. **Give up the fight. Put it down. Leave it there.**
- Not quite "stop stressing." More like: notice that stress is happening in a container of not-stress.
- The content of consciousness might be stress. But the context of consciousness is not stress, can't be stress; it's the container for the stress, and not-stress, and everything.
- **All the contents of consciousness are arising and falling away on their own. The context is always and already there.**

The search takes you away from the centre, the source. Movement takes you away from stillness.

### States

- What can drop away is states.
- **"I'm not getting it" is the same as "I've got it!"** (I think I feel tickles of Joshu's `mu` here).
- Stabilising nonduality is ... an oxymoron?
    - It's future-focused, not present- and now-focused.
    - **Measuring progress is a great way to avoid being present here and now.**
- **Looking for it means overlooking it.**
- Just let it be. **Just leave everything in its place.**
- The me, the one who wants an imagined future state, is an illusion.
- **"This isn't it" is just a thought. A seductive, hypnotic, one! But just a thought. Notice that.**

## Gathered notes from many other pages

- The context is always bright, clear, boundless, whatever the contents of consciousness.
- **Always and already here**, but temporarily concealed.
- **What we are looking for is always and already here.**
- What's always available? The clarity and stillness of the context of consciousness.
- **We can learn to notice that the first-person subjective view is always there.**
- Spiritual awakening points to the recognition of this unbound vastness that we are, this all-inclusive, unconditional love that is always accepting everything, this aware presence that often gets overlooked because attention is habitually focused on the me-story and the dramas in the movie of waking life.
- Only once we wait, free of any intention, in waiting lingering, do humans become aware of the space in which we always already are
- It’s always right here. So this takes no effort. It’s a relaxing and letting go, a dissolving, a releasing, a care-free-ness, allowing everything to be exactly as it is. 
- Notice the wider space that contains "this" and "not-this". They always exist together. The "not-this" is the backdrop to the "this."
- Sitting is about being what we always aready are.
- Just click into the awareness that's always and already there. Can you be not-aware? Try!
- Waking up isn't over there, it's here and now, **always and already**.
- What we're looking for, the calm / peace / enlightenment / Buddha-nature, is **always and already here**, but temporarily concealed.
- We have to decide and act within the relative dimension of our lives, but the absolute is always also there.
- Our true nature is always and already present.
- Being is always bright, whatever the contents of consciousness.
- Each moment is already perfect.
- Comfort is already here and now.
- “Dogen’s zazen is a ritual expression and celebration of awakening already present.”
- Notice how you deny that this awakeness is already present, how you postpone, how you look elsewhere.
- We already are what we want to become.
- Recognise what's already there, not acquire something that's missing.
- Consciousness is already at ease. No effort, no push or pull. No doer, no one.
