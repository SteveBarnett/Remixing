Thinking about [One Bright Pearl](/thinking/zen/one-bright-pearl/) (and [One Bright Impearlmanence Unit](/thinking/one-bright-impearlmanence-unit/)) and [flow states](/thinking/thinking-about-flow-states/) / [nondual glimpses](/thinking/some-nondual-glimpses/).

## Gathered thoughts

- The feeling of everything showing up together all at once
    - Lightly noticing the distinctions, but/and not think-creating the division
    - Lightly noticing the embodied me, but/and not think-creating the self
- The feeling of happy, playful, bright activity
    - Noticing the ongoing and complete flux and flow, but/and not think-creating static things
    - Noticing the focus on the process, but/and not think-creating a goal or target
- The feeling of non-doing, wu wei, happening
    - Noticing the deep interconnectedness and interwoveness, but/and not think-creating a doer
    - Noticing the mostly relaxed tempo, but/and not tried to stir and speed things up

## Some bullets from older pages

- the sense of separation falls away, the sense of self falls away
- everyday things feels sacred, wonderful, and precious
- things in the world feel fresh, new, and vivid
- Self-fulfilling and playful, not goal-based or outcome-based
- Slow(er) tempo, not rushed
- Loosen the timing, loosen the target, loosen the tightness
- interconnection, interdependence, inseparability
- wholeness, the completeness, the Perfection (in the Buddhist sense)
- Everything is included, showing up together all at once
- Everything is a verb, arising and passing away without a pause
- Everything is created by ongoing infinite causes and conditions
- Thought tries to divide things up
- Thought tries to make things static
