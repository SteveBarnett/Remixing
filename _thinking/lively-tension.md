## Preferences and hierarchies

- Part of being human is having preferences
- Having preferences automatically puts thing in hierarchies
- We can't get rid of these preferences (and hierarchies), but we can hold them more lightly

## Manifesting and poles

- All forms are relational. Things exist through and with other things.
- Things manifest as opposites, poles
- Our preferences map onto the poles, often as "is" and "could" (or "should")
- Poles are usually asymmetrical. For me, the could/should pole tends to be much heavier.

## Sameness and difference

- Sameness brings stillness, difference brings movement
- The tension, difference, between poles creates energy
- So the interaction of the poles makes motion

## Emptiness and energy

- Between the poles is emptiness, creative potential, possibility.
- The crackle of energy in the gap between "is" and "could" (or "should").
- Like the taut string of a drawn bow.

## Maintaining

- Our human tendencies and the asymmetrical nature of the poles work to make one side "win"
- Holding both at once requires constant work

## Flip-flopping

- I tend to not be able to hold both for long
- I have a tendency to swinging between opposites, to flip-flopping from one side to the other
- Sometimes I see the tilt happening and I scramble to get back to the (empty) middle

The trick is to keep at it, keeping your balance more often, for longer.
