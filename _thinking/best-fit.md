I have an ongoing obsession with "best fit". This is related to [Singular purpose / obsession / calling](/thinking/singular-purpose-obsession-calling/).

Over the past few decades I've mostly got the jobs that I've applied for. This is not because I'm some kind of ubermensch. It is, of course, partly due to luck and large amounts of privilege. It's also because I've tried to "rig the game" a bit by only applying for jobs where I really think that I am the best person for the job. Where I am the **best fit**.

I tend to do this with reading as well. I am quite the hungry, hungry, hippo when it comes to reading. And I tend to read quite broadly. I do tend to plan my reading ahead a bit, but I tend to hold that lightly. It's more like a backup. The next book I read tends to be the one that feels right. The one that addresses the most pressing need. The ones that's the **best fit** for where I am right now.
