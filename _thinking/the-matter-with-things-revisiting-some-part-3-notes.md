## Pulled together a bit more

- The cosmos is purposeful.
	- Value is intrinsic to reality.
	- Laws like gravity don't make things happen. Something underneath them does.
- Consciousness is on a continuum. 
	- Consciousness is a verb.
	- Life is more concentrated consciousness. It speeds up responsiveness.
		- Nature embodies drives, but they're not material.
- We are the cosmos becoming more aware of itself.
	- The process is the fulfilment.

## Pulled together a bit

- Negative Capability: remain in doubt and uncertainty.
	- Check what's consistent with observation, with the encounter of experience.
- Consciousness is a verb. Beauty, truth, goodness are aspects of it, adverbs.
- Rediscover the value of things as themselves, not as a resource.
	- Utility can’t explained beauty, truth, goodness. But it can degrade them!
- The cosmos, life, is purposeful. 
	- Nature embodies drives, but drives are not material.
	- Value is an intrinsic aspect of reality.
	- There aren’t values because there’s life, there’s life because there are values.
	- Laws like gravity don’t make things happen. Something underneath them does.
	- The point of existing is to exist well.
	- The process is the fulfilment.
- “God” is both transcendent and immanent.
- The cosmos is constantly speeding things up that are important to it.
- Life adds more, faster, more intense, responsiveness to the cosmos.
- The cosmos desires life, purpose, love, self-discovery.
- We are the cosmos becoming more itself, becoming more aware of itself.
- Consciousness is the universe looking at itself.
- The self is an individual expression of the collective.

## Truth

- Some truths are more complete, some are more partial. 
- Not "What is true?" but "When is this true? In what contexts?"
- The more important something is, the more difficult it is to grasp in language.
- Our mechanisms for simplifying the world so that we can control it prevent us from understanding it.
- Negative Capability: remain in doubt and uncertainty.

## Beauty, truth, goodness

- Consciousness is a verb. Beauty, truth, goodness are aspects of it, adverbs. 
- The three transcendentals: what is good, what is true, what is beautiful.
- Beauty is the unity of sameness and difference. 
- Beauty is an endless invitation to deepen the relationship.
- Attention is a creative act, a moral act.
- Rediscover the value of things as themselves, not as a resource.
- Utility can't explained beauty, truth, goodness. But it can degrade them!

## Purpose and Value

- Life is purposeful. It's not something humans have created.
- Values, meaning, purpose are dis-covered by us, not invented by us.
- Reality, seen and unseen, is one unified field of loving aliveness.
- There aren't values because there's life, there's life because there are values. 
- Value is an intrinsic aspect of reality, revealed through the encounter of experience.
- Laws like gravity don't make things happen. Something underneath them does.
- The point of existing is to exist well.
- Nature embodies drives, but drives are not material.
- Fulfil potential by appreciating and responding to value.

## The Cosmos

- "God" is both transcendent and immanent.
- The cosmos having a purpose is an unfashionable point of view, but is consistent with experience and observation.
- The process is the fulfilment. A dance, a poem, have intrinsic purpose.
- The cosmos is constantly speeding things up that are important to it. 
- Life adds more, faster, more intense, responsiveness to the cosmos. 
- The cosmos desires life, purpose, love, self-discovery.
- We are the cosmos becoming more itself, becoming more aware of itself.
- Consciousness is the universe looking at itself.

## Not-two

- To have seen it from one side only, is not to have seen it.
- The whole truth is the reconciliation and holding together of opposites.
- The many enhances the oneness with differentiation.
- We need to see the pieces and the whole, but the whole is more important.
- Have an intuitive, implicit, embodied, understanding of the world.
- The all-time of the whole becomes the no-time of the center.

## The self

- The self is an individual expression of the collective.
- We can't exist separately from our culture, the natural world, society.
- It's healthy to have a (healthy!) sense of self. Not individualism or narcissism.
