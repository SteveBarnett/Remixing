The next generation of [an earlier take](/thinking/my-philosophy-another-spiral/). This updates contains some tweaks from [studying Zen for a little bit](/thinking/zen/notes-from-six-months-of-studying-and-practicing-zen/). It seems to be shaping into a mix of metaphysics (what is real?) and epistemology (what is true?).

---

For me, a nondual practice seems to hit the spot.

- The idea that we are separate from the world is an illusion.
- The idea that we have a static, separate, self is an illusion.

Nothing, everything, humans / nonduality, consciousness, the path.

There's physical Reality. And there's this mystery of consciousness. And there's the path.

- **Reality is "empty". It's one, complex, flow.**
    - There are distinctions, but not divisions.
        - Things that are separate can't influence and act on each other.
    - Concepts try to make forms: separate, simple, static.
    - Characteristics are relative, they require thought and comparison.
    - The infinite causes and conditions of Reality create everything.
        - There's no doer. Everything happens on its own.
        - The knower and the know aren’t required, only the knowing, the verb.
    - **Our thoughts, actions, bodies, are in and of Reality.**
        - Our experience of Reality is not separate from Reality, but is localised in our bodymind.
        - The knower and the know aren’t required, only the knowing, the verb.
    - **All matter is swirls of degrees of consciousness.**
        - Life is consciousness that’s more concentrated.
- **Our true nature is the context of consciousness, not the contents.**
    - Anything that can be named or located can’t be you: it’s an object in awareness.
    - Open, empty, luminous, spacious, boundless.
    - The truth is experienced in the first instant. Before thoughts like classification, measuring, labelling.
    - When we are experience, there is no suffering. When we believe we're separate from it, there is suffering.
    - always and already here, but temporarily concealed.
    - It's close, not far away. It's on the surface, not deep down. 
    - Chasing the way takes you away from it.
    - Grasping creates the illusion that it’s far away.
- **The path is the goal.**
    - The process is the fulfilment.
    - Practice is enlightenment.
    - Acceptance, relaxing, resting.
    - Relaxing and resting, accepting what is.
    - Living with don’t-know mind.
    - The practice is loosening, in particular, the hold on the illusion of self. And of free will.
    - Living more frequently, for longer periods, from (nondual) Reality, direct experience, instead of concepts.
    - The union of Absolute and Relative, of emptiness and form.
    - (gradual, never-ending) actualisation, embodiment, and integration.

I'm (sort of) using <span class="gripmoji">🎯</span> to denote direct noticing and <span class="gripmoji">🏹</span> to denote indirect noticing (noticing an absence).

## Reality

<div class="boxout">Reality is one, complex, empty, flow.</div>

- **Reality is one, indivisible, whole.**
    - Only the whole is required.
    - There's distinction, but not division. And these exist on a spectrum.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice the causes, conditions, and patterns.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Look for the edges, the gaps between.
- **Reality is complex, deep, rich.**
    - <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice the fractal nature of everything.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Remember that the map is not the territory.
- **Reality is flow, motion, change.**
    - <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice the motion, the changes. Watch it arise, watch it pass away.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Look for what's static, fixed.
- **Reality is free of concepts, language, characteristics.**
    - It's empty of instrinsic, solid, stable, form(s), of boundaries.
    - Thinking, especially judging, creates separation, distance.

### Interpretations and observations

<div class="boxout">The cosmos is purposeful, patterned, and playful.</div>

- **The cosmos is purposeful, patterned.**
    - Value is intrinsic to Reality. Utility can’t explain beauty, truth, goodness.
    - But/and: only the verb is required. There's no separation of subject and object. There's no doer.
    - 🎯 Notice the directionality, purposefulness, of things.
- **The cosmos is playful.**
    - 🎯 Notice the playful nature of everything. There's exploring and realising, playing hide and seek.

## Consciousness

<div class="boxout">Our true nature is the (open, empty, luminous) context of consciousness. Everything is arising and passing away on its own.</div>

- **Our true nature, our first-person experience, is the context of consciousness, not the contents.**
    - <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Come back to the direct, embodied, experience.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Look for yourself, at zero distance.
    - Subject and object arise as a pair in awareness.
- **Our true nature, our first-person experience, is free of concepts, language, characteristics.**
    - There's no separate, solid, stable, self.
    - It’s empty of intrinsic, solid, stable, form, of boundaries.
- **Reality is the source of all our thoughts and actions.**
    - We are not doing in the world, the world is doing us.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Look for thinker of thoughts and notice the absence.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Look for source of an action, a decision, and notice the absence.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice the causes and conditions that lead to your suffering.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice the causes, conditions, patterns that make you who you are.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Leave things as they are, without adding a story or a label.
- **But/and: we create our own reality.**
    - Perception is participation, and creates different forms, depending on the scale.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice (the details of) the map you're using.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Negative Capability: remain in doubt and uncertainty. 
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Take the more integrated picture, multiple viewpoints at once.

### Interpretations and observations

- **The cosmos is consciousness as a verb.**
    - All matter is swirls of degrees of consciousness.
    - Life is consciousness that’s more concentrated.
    - Consciousness is the cosmos becoming more aware of itself.

## The path

What we can do.

<div class="boxout">Take the path as the goal. Treat the everyday as sacred.</div>

- **The path is the goal.**
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Don't obsess over the destination.
- **Liberation is seeing through the illusion of there being a problem.**
    - <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span> [Remember the three uhds](/thinking/the-three-uhds/). Let go of the shoulds. Let go of the coulds. Rest in the good(s).
    - Our ideas of happiness can stop us being happy.
- **What we are looking for is always and already here.**
    - It's close, not far away. It's on the surface, not deep down. 
    - <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Do less, not do more.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Just do what needs to be done. Free of goals or outcomes.
- **Take everything as our main practice.**
    - The mundane is sacred.
- **Why can't it be both?**
    - The union of Absolute and Relative, of emptiness and form.
