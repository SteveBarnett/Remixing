How about: values?

---
-->

## The cosmos

- **The cosmos is purposeful.**
    - Value is intrinsic to Reality.
    - Utility can’t explained beauty, truth, goodness.
    - 🎯 Notice the patterns and variations of everything.
- **The cosmos is playful.**
    - 🎯 Notice the playful nature of everything, exploring and realising, playing hide and seek.
- **Consciousness is a continuum.**
    - All matter is swirls of degrees of consciousness.
    - Life is consciousness that’s more concentrated.
    - Consciousness is a verb: the cosmos becoming more aware of itself.

## Reality

- **Reality is one, indivisible, whole.**
    - Only the whole is required.
    - Only the verb is required.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice the causes, conditions, and patterns.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Look for the edges, the gaps between.
    - **The union of Absolute and Relative, of emptiness and form.**
- **Reality is flow, motion, change.**
    - <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice the motion, the changes. Watch it arise, watch it pass away.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Look for what's static, fixed. 
- **Reality is complex, deep, rich.**
    - <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice the fractal nature of everything.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Remember that the map is not the territory.
- The Absolute is free of concepts, language, characteristics.
    - Thinking, especially judging, creates separation, distance, suffering.

## Consciousness

- **Your true nature is the context of consciousness, not the contents.**
    - <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Come back to the direct, embodied, experience.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Look for yourself, at zero distance.
    - Subject and object arise as a pair in awareness.
- **Reality is the source of all our thoughts and actions.**
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Look for thinker of thoughts and notice the absence.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Look for source of an action, a decision, and notice the absence.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice the causes and conditions that lead to your suffering.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice the causes, conditions, patterns that make you who you are.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Leave things as they are, without adding a story or a label.
- Our ideas of happiness can stop us being happy.
- **Perception is participation, and creates different forms, depending on the scale.**
    - <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice (the details of) the map you're using.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Negative Capability: remain in doubt and uncertainty. 
    - <span class="gripmoji">🏹 </span>Take the more integrated picture, multiple viewpoints at once.

## The path

- **The path is the goal.**
- What you are looking for is always and already here.
    - It's close, not far away. It's on the surface, not deep down. 
    - Do less, not do more.
- The mundane is sacred.
- Everything is our main practice.
- Wu wei. Just do what needs to be done. Free of goals or outcomes. Self-fulfilling activity.
- Take care of your suffering.
- **Liberation is seeing through the illusion of there being a problem.**
    - <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice that the need to solve the problem is a story.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice the problem itself is a story.
    - <span class="gripmoji">🎯 </span>Notice that the self is a story.
- Let go of the shoulds. Let go of the coulds. Rest in the good(s). ([The three uhds](/thinking/the-three-uhds/))
- The answering is in the questioning.
