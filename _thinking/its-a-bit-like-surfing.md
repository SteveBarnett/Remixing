(The start of a line of thinking)

Like a surfer sitting on their board in the ocean.

Even while at rest, there's a bobbing up and down. A gentle balancing, staying in place. Rest isn't static and still. Like a body at rest, breathing in and out.

But there's also an alertness. Soft eyes looking at the sea, to notice a wave when it arises. Not staring and straining watching for a wave, but looking openly and receptively at the sea.

Riding a wave, following a thought, takes sustained effort. As soon as you stop the effort, you start to drift, and quickly it dissipates.
