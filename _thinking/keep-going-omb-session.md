## Session notes

### Preamble

- This is the last session of the year.
- We'll be back on 15th January.
- Retreat on Saturday 15th February. Reminder again at the end, and later in the WhatsApp group.
- Inspired by the [Austin Kleon book](https://austinkleon.com/keepgoing/). "10 ways to stay creative in good times and bad".
    - Lots of the lessons can be applied more widely. For example, to meditation.
- One of the first things in the book is "I wrote this book because I needed to read it."
    - This is how I feel about this session. I'm facilitating this session because I need to attend it.
    - "A few ways to keep meditating in good times and bad".
    - How can we **keep going** with meditation over the break?
- What's on top? Your name, what's on top for you.

### Introduction

- Austin Kleon is "a writer who draws." He makes art with words and books with pictures.
- He lives in in Austin, Texas, USA.
- Keep Going is the third book in a series about creativity.
- For me, his style is quite similar to Tara Brach's.
    - It's wise words, skilfully presented, well sized, mixed with quotes and stories, sprinkles of humour.
- The book has ten sections, each with a handful of smaller lessons in.
    - We'll look at a handful of things.

### Sketching out ideas

TODO: Link each bullet to meditation as a way of culling.

- Every day is Groundhog day
    - **! Take one day at a time.**
        - I'm taking a different read on this than he does in the book. My angle: don't worry about yesterday. Whether you meditated or not. Whether it was a "good" one or not. And don't worry about whether you'll meditate tomorrow. That's tomorrow's problem. Just think about today. And do a meditation. Even if it's a tiny one.
-  Build a bliss station
    - **? Airplane mode can be a way of life.**
        - Are we all familiar with airplane mode on our phones? It turns off all in/out signals, cuts you off from all the usual distractions. Why not replicate the experience on the ground?
- ! Forget the noun, do the verb
    - **"Creative" is not a noun.**
        - "Let go of the thing that you're trying to be (the noun), and focus on the actual work you need to be doing (the verb). Doing the verb will take you someplace further and far more interesting."
        - Job titles can be restrictive.
        - Don't worry about being a good meditator. Or even being a meditator. Just meditate.
- ! The ordinary + extra attention = the extraordinary
    - **You have everything you need**
        - Make common experiences uncommon by paying them more attention, noticing the details.
        - (Magritte) Breathe new life into the way we look at the ordinary things around us.
    - **Slow down and draw things out**
        - "It's impossible to pay proper attention to your life if you are hurtling along at lightning speed."
        - "In an age obsessed with speed, slowing down requires special training."
        - (Slow Art Day) "When people look slowly ...  they make discoveries."
        - (Rephrased) "Because meditation is really an exercise in noticing, you can suck at it and still get a ton out of it."
    - **Pay attention to what you pay attention to**
        - "You attention is one of the most valuable things you possess, which is why everyone wants to steal it from you."
        - "What you pay attention to is the stuff your life and work will be made of."
        - (Mary Oliver, American poet) "To pay attention, this is our endless and proper work."
        - (Jos√© Ortega y Gasset, Spanish liberal philosopher and essayist) "Tell me what you pay attention to and I will tell you who you are."
- Slay the art monsters
    - Art if for life (not the other way around)
        - The more needs more decent human beings more than it needs more Xs.
- ? You are allowed to change your mind
    - **To change is to be alive**
        - "We're afraid of changing our minds because we're afraid of the consequences of changing our minds. What will people think?"
        - "You start each work not knowing exactly where you're going or where you'll end up. Hope is about moving forward in the face of uncertainty." 
        - (Rebecca Solnit, American writer) "Hope is an embrace of the unknown and the unknowable."
        - "To have hope, we must acknowledge that we don't know everything and we don't know what's going to happen. ... be open to possibility and allow ourselves to be changed."
- ! Demons hate fresh air
    - **To exercise is to exorcise**
        - (Diogenes the Cynic) "It is solved by walking"
        - "What I've learned on our morning walks is that, yes, walking is great for releasing inner demons, but maybe even more important, walking is great for battling our out demons. (phones, TV, etc)"
            - See the world as it is, not as the media portrays it.
- Plant your garden
    - **Creativity has seasons**
        - "Part of the work is to know what season you're in, and act accordingly."
        - (George Carlin) "It's the ... view that everything has to keep climbing. ... Not time to contract before another expansion. ... No time to learn from your mistakes. But that notion goes against nature, which is cyclical."
        - "You have to give yourself time to change and observe your own patterns."
    - **This, too, shall pass**
        - Take the long view
        - "Because gardening requires so much patience and attention, gardeners have a unique sense of time and perspective."
- Endnote
    - "Go easy on yourself and take your time. Worry less about getting things done. Worry more about things worth doing. Keep going."

## Initial notes

- Inspired by the [Austin Kleon book](https://austinkleon.com/keepgoing/). [My notes](https://stevebarnett.me/notes/process/keep%20going.jpg).
- Using things that are not-meditation to help with our practice.
- Seeing practice as a creative endeavour.
- Things like:
    - The process, not the prize.
    - Forget the noun, do the verb.
    - The extraordinary is just the ordinary with extra attention applied to it.
    - To exercise is to exorcise.
    - Plant your garden.

## Blurb for event

Title: "Keep Going: a guide to continuing meditation in good times and bad"

üìò Topic: keeping our practice going over the break. In this session we'll be using a... non-traditional source to help us with our meditation. We'll discuss a few ideas from Austin Kleon's book Keep Going (https://austinkleon.com/keepgoing/). We'll cover: focusing on the process over the prize; forgetting the noun and doing the verb; how the extraordinary is just the ordinary with extra attention applied to it.

üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Meditation: as usual, we'll end the session with a meditation of about 20 minutes.
