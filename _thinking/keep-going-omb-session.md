## Preamble

- This is the last session of the year.
- We'll be back on 15th January.
- Retreat on Saturday 15th February. Reminder again at the end, and later in the WhatsApp group.
- What's on top? Your name, what's top of mind for you.

## Introduction

- Inspired by the book [Keep Going by Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/keepgoing/). "10 ways to stay creative in good times and bad".
    - We're going to be cheeky and use it for "A few ways to keeping meditating in good times and bad." Specifically, over the break.
    - Austin Kleon calls himself "a writer who draws." He makes art with words and books with pictures.
- One of the first things in the book is "I wrote this book because I needed to read it."
    - This is how I feel about this session.
    - I'm facilitating this session because I need to attend it.
- We'll look at a handful of things. I hope for this to mostly be discussion rather than me talking.

How can we keep going with meditation? Over the break? In good times and bad?

## Take one day at a time

> The <del>creative</del> meditative life is not linear. It's not a straight line from point A to B. It's more like a loop, or a spiral, in which you keep coming back to a new starting point after every <del>project</del> experience. No matter how <del>successful you get</del> well you do, no matter what level of achievement you reach, you will never really 'arrive'.

- Try and hold our ideas of progress of lightly.
- Realise that we'll have to relearn the same lessons, or a remix of the same lessons.
- Let go of the stress and anxiety of getting to a certain place in our meditation practice. 

## <del>"Creative"</del> "Meditator" is not a noun.

> Let go of the thing that you're trying to be (the noun), and focus on the actual work you need to be doing (the verb). Doing the verb will take you someplace further and far more interesting.

> "I don't know what I am. I know that I am not a category. I am not a thing-a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process."

- Let go of worrying about being a meditator.
- Or being a good meditator.
- Just meditate.

## <del>Creativity</del> Meditation has seasons

> Part of the work is to know what season you're in, and act accordingly.

> "It's the <del>American</del> popular view that everything has to keep <del>climbing</del> increasing. ... No time to contract before another expansion. ... No time to learn from your mistakes. But that notion goes against nature, which is cyclical."
<p class="quote-source">&mdash; quoting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin">George Carlin</a>, comedian, 1937‚Äì2008.</p>

<blockquote class="alt" markdown="1">
- Instead of seconds, heartbeats
- Instead of days, sunrises
- Instead of week or months, moon phases
- Instead of quarters, seasons
- Instead of years, the return of spring
</blockquote>

> You have to pay attention to the rhythms and cycles of your <del>creative output</del> meditation practice and learn to be patient in the off-seasons. You have to give yourself time to change and observe your own patterns.

> "Imitate the tress. Learn to lose in order to recover, and remember that nothing stays the same for long."

- Be kind to yourself if your meditation isn't going so well.
- Be and patient with yourself if you're not as mindful as you'd like to be.
- Prefer measuring time by natural-based measures than human measures.

## To change is to be alive

> You start each <del>work</del> meditation not knowing exactly where you're going or where you'll end up. ... Hope is about moving forward in the face of uncertainty. It's a way of dealing with uncertainty.

> "Hope is an embrace of the unknown and the unknowable."
{: .alt}
<p class="quote-source">&mdash; <a href="http://rebeccasolnit.net/">Rebecca Solnit</a>, writer.</p>

> To have hope, you must acknowledge that you don't know everything and you don't know what's going to happen. That's the only way to keep going and the only way to keep <del>making art</del> meditating: to be open to possibility and allow yourself to be changed.

- Acknowledge and accept that many things are unknown and unknowable.
- Settle into hope as a strategy for dealing with this. We don't know, but we'll figure it out.
- Be open to how a meditation, and your practice, might go on any given day.
- Let yourself be changed by meditation. Smooth, soothed.

## Airplane mode can be a way of life

> "Almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes-including you."
{: .alt}
<p class="quote-source">&mdash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Lamott">Anne Lamott</a>, novelist and nonfiction writer.</p>

> (Talking about airplane mode) <del>But</del> why not replicate the experience on the ground? You don't need to be on a plane to practice airplane mode: <del>pop in some cheap earplugs and</del> switch your phones <del>or tablet</del> to airplane mode, and you can transform any mundane commute or stretch of captive time into an opportunity to reconnect with yourself and your work.

- Hold our ideas of what form meditation has to take lightly.
- It doesn't have to be sitting, eyes closed, lotus position.
- It can be as simple as waiting for the bus with our phone on airplane mode, and just paying more attention to whatever's around us.
- Any time we're waiting for something or someone can be a chance to mindful.

## Closing

- Endnote from book.
    - "Go easy on yourself and take your time. Worry less about getting things done. Worry more about things worth doing. **Keep going.**"
- We'll be back on 15th January.
- Retreat on Saturday 15th February. Reminder later in the WhatsApp group.
- Dana / donation.
- Tea and biscuits.

## Blurb for event

Title: "Keep Going: a guide to continuing meditation in good times and bad"

üìò Topic: keeping our practice going over the break. In this session we'll be using a... non-traditional source to help us with our meditation. We'll discuss a few ideas from Austin Kleon's book Keep Going (https://austinkleon.com/keepgoing/). We'll cover: focusing on the process over the prize; forgetting the noun and doing the verb; how the extraordinary is just the ordinary with extra attention applied to it.

üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Meditation: as usual, we'll end the session with a meditation of about 20 minutes.
