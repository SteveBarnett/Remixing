## Session notes

### Preamble

- This is the last session of the year.
- We'll be back on 15th January.
- Retreat on Saturday 15th February. Reminder again at the end, and later in the WhatsApp group.
- Inspired by the [Austin Kleon book](https://austinkleon.com/keepgoing/). "10 ways to stay creative in good times and bad".
    - Lots of the lessons can be applied more widely. For example, to meditation.
- One of the first things in the book is "I wrote this book because I needed to read it."
    - This is how I feel about this session. I'm facilitating this session because I need to attend it.
    - "A few ways to keep meditating in good times and bad".
    - How can we **keep going** with meditation over the break?
- What's on top? Your name, what's on top for you.

### Introduction

- Austin Kleon is "a writer who draws." He makes art with words and books with pictures.
- He lives in in Austin, Texas, USA.
- Keep Going is the third book in a series about creativity.
- For me, his style is quite similar to Tara Brach's.
    - It's wise words, skilfully presented, well sized, mixed with quotes and stories, sprinkles of humour.
- The book has ten sections, each with a handful of smaller lessons in.
    - We'll look at a handful of things.

### Closing

- We'll be back on 15th January.
- Retreat on Saturday 15th February. Reminder later in the WhatsApp group.
- Dana / donation.
- Tea and biscuits.

## Initial notes

- Inspired by the [Austin Kleon book](https://austinkleon.com/keepgoing/). [My notes](https://stevebarnett.me/notes/process/keep%20going.jpg).
- Using things that are not-meditation to help with our practice.
- Seeing practice as a creative endeavour.
- Things like:
    - The process, not the prize.
    - Forget the noun, do the verb.
    - The extraordinary is just the ordinary with extra attention applied to it.
    - To exercise is to exorcise.
    - Plant your garden.

## Blurb for event

Title: "Keep Going: a guide to continuing meditation in good times and bad"

üìò Topic: keeping our practice going over the break. In this session we'll be using a... non-traditional source to help us with our meditation. We'll discuss a few ideas from Austin Kleon's book Keep Going (https://austinkleon.com/keepgoing/). We'll cover: focusing on the process over the prize; forgetting the noun and doing the verb; how the extraordinary is just the ordinary with extra attention applied to it.

üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Meditation: as usual, we'll end the session with a meditation of about 20 minutes.
