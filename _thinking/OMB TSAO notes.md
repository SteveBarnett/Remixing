- The Spectrum of Awareness is four ways to meditate.
    - A map / model for awarenesss.
    - Bring some fluidity and flexibility to your practice.
- Different ways to meditate
    - Not hierarchical
    - Useful for different things and situations.
    - Vary by:
        - **object** of meditation
        - **width** of attention
        - amount of **effort**

### The four kinds

- **Focused Awareness**: one object, very narrow, high effort.
    - Cultivates concentration, tames a busy mind, clarifying.
- **Investigative Awareness**: one main object, narrow, some effort.
    - Good for being flexible, but controlled.
    - Good for noticing the tone of moods, emotions, memories, and for noticing their impermanence.
    - "Investigative" like exploring experientially, not like detective thinking.
    - Still connected to the anchor, but a little room to explore.
- **Choiceless Awareness**: several objects, broad, variable effort.
    - Good for flexibility, relaxing and resting.
    - Also called Open Awareness. Just sit and notice whatever arises, moment after moment.
- **Natural Awareness**: no objects, very broad, effortless.
    - Highlights impermanence, fluidity.

## Minitation: Investigative flowing into Choiceless

<div class="boxout">About 5 minutes.</div>

We'll start with our anchor. Then when we get pulled away, let our attention rest on the object briefly, notice it. Then gently back to the anchor. Then after a minute or two we'll lightly let go of our anchor.


- Settle into a comfortable posture.
- Bring your attention to your anchor.
    - Part of your body that feels at ease, solid, safe, stable, pleasant.
    - Maybe your breath.
    - Pay close attention to your anchor. Notice everything you can about it.
- When something pulls you away, just notice it.
    - There's no need to judge or evaluate it, just notice it.
    - Maybe it's an emotion. Or a thought. Or a sensation in your body.
    - Let it hold your attention for a moment.
    - If it's something that feels difficult, that's okay.
        - See if you can let whatever is there be there.
        - See if you can leave it where it is. Soften around it.
        - Gently come back to your anchor.
- Notice your anchor.
    - Then noticing what else arises, giving it your full attention.
    - Then coming back to your anchor.
- Now, loosen your hold on your anchor. Keep alert, but don't worry about coming back to it.
    - Let go of the story and just notice that what's arising keeps changing.
        - Just pay clear attention to whatever is arising.
    - Try and let go of like or don't like, and just notice things arise and pass away.
    - Sounds, just noticing them, not getting lost in a story
    - Body sensations. Movement, heaviness, tingling, warmth, vibration.
    - Emotions. Like sadness or joy, frustration. Simply notice.
    - Thoughts. What’s happening? Planning, imagining, remembering.
- Now bring attention back to your anchor.
- Take a few deep breaths.

## DIY intro

<div class="boxout">About 1 minute, for a 15 minute sit.</div>

- We'll end with about 15 minutes of DIY.
    - Pick one, or more, of the styles that we had tiny tastes of, and sit with it a bit longer.
    - No guidance for this bit of sit.
- As a quick reminder, the four were:
    - **Focused Awareness**: one object, very narrow, high effort.
    - **Investigative Awareness**: one main object, narrow, some effort.
    - **Choiceless Awareness**: several objects, broad, variable effort.
    - **Natural Awareness**: no objects, very broad, effortless.
- You might like to do a "Full Spectrum" version: Focused into Investigative into Choiceless into Natural.
- Take a few moments to set your intention.
- ...
- Three bells to start, three bells to finish.
