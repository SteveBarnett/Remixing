I tend to be a little nervous and anxious, so I like (re)reading and (re)thinking and ways to soften that.

- What you resist tends to persist
- The gold-standard acceptance and commitment: accepting the nerves; committing to valued action
- If you're nervous **before**
    - remind yourself it's a sign **you care**
    - that it's (the body) **getting ready**
    - that you can reframe it as excitement
    - that once the event starts **you'll settle in**
- If you get knocked off-kilter **during**
    - **calm down with self-talk, breathing techniques, to regulate and reset**
- You get better with practice
    - With experience and time, the nerves usually fade a bit
    - **Give yourself some grace** for being human

## Notes from ["Overcoming Performance Anxiety" on The Growth Equation](https://thegrowtheq.com/overcoming-performance-anxiety/)

- We know from decades of research that the worst way to make anxiety go away is by trying really hard to make anxiety go away. **What you resist tends to persist.**
- The only difference is that the non-elite swimmers labeled them as anxiety and tried to make them go away, whereas the elite swimmers labeled them as a part of the sport, as **a sign of caring**, and the body **getting ready** to perform.
- Those who tried to get rid of anxiety before presentations fared worse than those who **sat with the feelings and reframed them as “excitement.”**
- In our experience coaching and counseling high performers, one of the biggest unlocks is helping people realize that pre-performance anxiety is **normal** and that **acceptance and reframing are often the best paths forward**. But **there is nuance, and it’s important.**

### When to Calm Down and When to Accept

- **If you’re nervous before** public speaking, a big meeting, or an exam, accept the nerves; **tell yourself they are a sign you care** (because that’s precisely what they are); and **remind yourself that once the actual event starts, you’ll settle in.**
- **If you stutter, lose your spot**, your pencil breaks, or someone interrupts you when you least expect it, **that’s a great time for self-talk, a quick visualization, or a breathing technique to help you regulate and reset**.

### There is No Substitute for Experience and Guts

- The way to make strong sensations dull is by getting reps under your belt, by **facing the nerves and taking them along for the ride, over and over again.**
- It’s why the gold-standard treatment for clinical and generalized anxiety is "**Acceptance and Commitment**," which, in its simplest form, means **accepting the nerves and committing to showing up and living out your values anyways**. Do that, and **after a while, the nerves usually fade**. It’s simple, but that doesn’t make it easy. It takes guts.
- instead of trying to fight it or make it go away, normalize what you are feeling. Reframe the sensations as a sign of caring and readiness.
- **Give yourself some grace for being a human** and experiencing human feelings.
- Anxiety isn’t always the enemy. Sometimes, it simply means that what you are attempting is hard, and that you care. Nothing is wrong with that. Caring is fuel. Learning to ride the waves is an important skill, and like any other skill, you get better with practice.
